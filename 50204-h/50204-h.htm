HE Object in giving to the
Public this new Edition of
the <i>Wonders of the Invisible
World</i>, is mainly to preserve an
accurate Reprint of that <i>wonderful</i>
Book. At the same Time it is intended
to show that its Author has unjustly
been singled out and held up to everlasting
Scorn, as though he had been the
Instigator of the whole Mischief; that
from his high Standing socially he was
more prominent than any other Man, and
that this occasioned his being especially
held responsible is clearly true. His ready
Pen also largely contributed to place him
in the front Rank of those whom that
woeful Delusion led captive; he having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>
written more largely upon the Subject
than any other.</p>

<p>The first Edition of the <i>Wonders of the
Invisible World</i> was published in Boston
early in the Year 1693, at which Time
<i>Witches</i> had begun to grow scarce; in
other Words, Prosecutions had nearly
ceased, and People were seriously looking
about themselves, and anxiously inquiring
what they had been about? The
serious Inquirers were those (though few
in Number) who had from the Beginning
had Doubts as to the Reality of
Witchcraft. When this Class began to
reason, their Strength began to concentrate,
and in due Time it put an End to
the Horrors which had so strongly tended
to the Ruin of the whole Community.
Until this Reaction was brought about,
no Person was for a Moment safe. Notwithstanding
this frightful State of Things
was thus brought to a Stand, a large
Portion of the People retained all their
Faith in the Reality of Witchcraft, and
many of them exclaimed in Despair, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">v</a></span>
"the Kingdom of Satan had prevailed,"
and that they were a "God-forsaken
People." In this latter Class was the
Author of the <i>Wonders of the Invisible
World</i>. He never wavered in his Faith
to the very End, because his Conviction
that he had espoused the Truth was
stronger than any Argument which could
be brought against it. Some others of the
Ministers, and one or two of the Judges
were equally sanguine in their own
Righteousness. And yet we find the
following cautious Piece of Advice given
by "several Ministers to his Excellency
and the Honourable Council":&mdash;"We
judge that in the Prosecution of these,
and all such Witchcrafts, there is Need of
a very critical and exquisite Caution, lest
by too much Credulity for Things received
only upon the Devil's Authority,
there be a Door opened for a long Train
of miserable Consequences, and Satan get
an Advantage over us, for we should not
be ignorant of his Devices." For all this
it is not easy to discover the Practice of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
any of that "exquisite Caution" in the
Proceedings against those accused.</p>

<p>No sooner was the Edition of the
<i>Wonders</i> printed in Boston, than Copies
were sent to London and reprinted there
with all Dispatch, as will be seen by the
"<i>Imprimatur</i>" in the Front of the Work.
Mr. Deodat Lawson's "<i>Brief and True
Narrative</i>" of the same Affair was printed
in Boston in 1692, by Benj. Harris, and
the next Year in London by John Dunton,
in Connection with Dr. Increase Mather's
"<i>Further Account of the Tryals of the
New England Witches</i>." A second (in
Fact, it was the third) Edition of Mr.
Lawson's Work was issued in London in
1704, which, though he calls it a <i>second
Edition</i> is quite a different Book from the
first Edition. In the first he inserted the
Names of the Parties, while in the last,
Dashes stand in their Stead. It has two
Dedications: one "To the Right Worshipful
and truly Honourable, Sir Henry
Ashhurst, Barr<sup>t</sup>. and to His Truly Honourable
and Religious Consort, Lady Diana
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
Ashhurst, Barr<sup>t</sup>:" signed Deodat Lawson.
The other is "To the Worshipful and Worthily
Honoured <i>Bartholomew Gidney</i>, <i>John
Hathorne</i>, and <i>Jonathan Corwin</i>, Esqrs.
Together with the Reverend <i>Mr. John
Higginson</i>, Pastor, and Mr. <i>Nicholas Noyes</i>
Teacher of the Church of Christ at Salem."
Signed Deodat Lavson. It should
be mentioned also that Dr. I. Mather's
"<i>Further Account</i>," &amp;c., contains Nothing
beyond a Reprint of Lawson's Book, (first
Edition) except a "<i>Letter</i>" containing
"<i>A further Account of the Tryals of the
New England Witches</i>," sent "<i>to a Gentleman
in London</i>." This Letter was
added at the End of the "<i>Further Account</i>."
It was probably written by Mr.
Mather to John Dunton, his Friend and
Publisher, and occupies about three additional
Pages.</p>

<p>In this Reprint of the <i>Wonders</i> I have
followed the second Edition, presuming
that to be the most accurate, as the Copy
from which it was printed was doubtless
furnished by the Author.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>

Very few Copies of the original Edition
are known to be in Existence. I have
never owned one, and am indebted to my
Friend, <span class="smcap">George Brinley</span>, Esq., for the Use
of his (rather imperfect) Copy. While
this Preface was in the Hands of the
Printer, my Publisher, Mr. <span class="smcap">Woodward</span>,
has had the rare Fortune to obtain a very
good one.</p>

<p>At this Period the Press literally
swarmed with Works upon Witchcraft.
Dunton printed in rapid Succession all the
Works from New England, and other
Publishers were equally busy. It would
be a Matter of no little Curiosity if some
one would collect the Titles of the Works
on this Subject, and publish them in
Book Form, with, or even without Abstracts
of their Contents. In a unique
Volume now before me, belonging to
Harvard College Library&mdash;for the Loan
of which I am indebted to the Kindness
of Mr. <span class="smcap">Sibley</span>, the Librarian&mdash;there are
several Tracts, the Titles of which are
quite as singular as any of the Mathers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
One or two I will here extract. "The
Lancashire Levite Rebuk'd: or, a Vindication
of the Dissenters from Popery,
Superstition, Ignorance, and Knavery,
unjustly Charged on them by Mr. Zachary
Taylor in his Book, entitled, "The Surry
Impostor." Another runs thus: "The
Devil turn'd Casuist or the Cheats of
Rome laid open, in the Exorcism of a
Despairing Devil, at the House of Thomas
Pennington in Orrel in the Parish of
Wigan in the County of Lancaster. By
Zachary Taylor, M. A. Chaplin to the
right reverend Father in God, Nicholas
[Strafford] Lord Bishop of Chester, and
Rector of Wigan."</p>

<p>Witch Books, as they were called, of
the Father Land, must have been common
among the People of New England, as
will be seen by a Comparison of the
Trials of Witches in both Countries.
This Comparison shows that the accused
in this Country were well acquainted
with the ridiculous Nonsense of what had
been and was passing at Witch Trials <span class="err" title="original: i">in</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
England. The same Cant and Incoherency
are visible at every Step. Insomuch,
that the Frivolity, Shallow-mindedness
and Falsity were so apparent, that they
remind one of the childish Nursery Tales
of Youth, and excite the most profound
Wonder how they could have ever been
viewed as Matter for serious Consideration
by any Persons having any Pretensions to
common Sense.</p>

<p>The original Records of the Court
Proceedings against those accused of
Witchcraft were never fully given to the
Public, until about two Years ago, Mr. W.
Elliot Woodward, of Roxbury, caused a
complete Transcript to be made of the
whole, and printed them in two Volumes,
small Quarto, uniform with this Undertaking.
Those, with the present Volumes,
will put the Student of New
England History in Possession of nearly
all the Materials existing upon this deeply
interesting, though humiliating, and in
some respects, revolting Subject.</p>

<img src="images/i_f011a.jpg" width="100" height="169" alt="A" class="figleft" />
S a Belief in Witchcraft is not entirely
exploded, it may be interesting to
examine a few of the early Definitions
of it.</p>

<p>One of the earliest Lexicographers, or
Expounders of English Words, was Edward
Phillips, the Nephew of John Milton.
It is said that Phillips made up his Work from
Milton's Preparation in the same Line. However
that might be, it is quite clear that many of his
Definitions have that Clearness and Precision for
which Milton is so remarkable. Phillips's third
(and I believe his last) Edition of "The New
World of Words" was printed in 1671. In that
we find Witchcraft thus defined: "A certain
evill Art, whereby with the Assistance of the
Devil, or evill Spirits, some Wonders may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
wrought, which exceed the common Apprehension
of Men: It cometh from the Dutch Word
<i>Wiechelen</i>, that is, to divine, or guesse; it is called
in Latin Veneficium, in Greek <i>Pharmaceia</i>, i.e.
the Art of making Poisons."</p>

<p>In 1706, John Kersey published the sixth Edition
of Philips's Work, greatly augmented;
though the Definition of <i>Witchcraft</i> is cut down
to a few Words, thus: "The Black Art, whereby
with the Assistance of the Devil, or evil Spirits,
some Wonders may be wrought, which exceed
the common Apprehensions of Men."</p>

<p>Phillips does not define a <i>Witch</i>, but he says a
"Wizard is a Witch, a cunning Man, one that
telleth where things are that were lost. Some
think it comes from the Saxon Word <i>Witega</i>, i.e.
a Prophet."</p>

<p>Kersey defines a Witch, an old Hag, or Woman
that deals with Familiar Spirits; and a Wizard
"a Sorceror, or Inchanter; a Cunning Man,"
&amp;c., as before.</p>

<p>In 1674, Thomas Blount published the fourth
Edition of his "Glossographia, or Dictionary of
hard Words." He says, "Witch is derived from
the Dutch <i>Witchelen</i>, or <i>Wiichelen</i>, which properly
signifies whinnyng and neighing like a Horse;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
also to foretell or prophecy; and <i>Wiichelen</i>, signifies
a Soothsayer; for that the Germans (from
whom our Ancestors the Saxons usually descended)
did principally (as Tacitus tells us) divine and
foretel Things to come by the whinnying and
neighing of their Horses; <i>Hinitus</i> and <i>Trenitus</i>
are his Words."</p>

<p>Witchcraft is not defined by Blount himself;
while under the Article <i>Witch</i>, he extracts from
Master William Perkins: "Witchcraft is an Art
serving for the working of Wonders by the Assistance
of the Devil, so far as God will permit."
To make the Definition of Witchcraft still more
plain, Mr. Blount extracts thus from an old
Author named <i>Delrio</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> who defines Witchcraft
to be "An Art, which by the Power of a Contract,
entred into with the Devil, some Wonders
are wrought, which pass the common Understanding
of Men."</p>

<p>As we approach a later Age, Lexicographers
are pretty careful in their Definitions of Witchcraft.
Bailey, in his folio Dictionary of 1730,
says it is "the Art of bewitching, enchanting, divining,
&amp;c."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
Johnson, though a Believer in Witchcraft,
shirks the Definition of it thus: "The Practice
of Witches. <i>Bacon</i>. Power, more than natural.
<i>Sidney</i>."</p>

<p>Noah Webster published a Dictionary of the
English Language in 1806, in which he says a
<i>Witch</i> is "a Woman accused of magical Arts, a
Hag." Witchcraft, "the Practice of Witches, a
Charm." The great Lexicographer must have
marvelled at these Definitions in his later Years;
if so, he fails to make due Atonement in his incomparable
"Unabridged." But the learned
Editor of the "Imperial Dictionary,"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Dr. Ogilvie,
appears to have taken such Liberty with Dr.
Webster's Work as to bring it up to the Standard
of the Times, especially in that Class of Words in
which <i>Witchcraft</i> is prominent. His Definition
is so much to the Point, so clear, and so well expressed,
that it is, though long, extracted entire:
"<span class="smcap">Witchcraft</span>, the Practice of Witches; Sorcery;
Enchantments; Intercourse with the Devil;
a supernatural Power, which Persons were formerly
supposed to obtain Possession of by entering
into Compact with the Devil. Indeed it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>
fully believed that they gave themselves up to
him, Body and Soul, while he engaged that they
should want for Nothing and be able to assume
whatever Shape they pleased, to visit and torment
their Enemies, and accomplish their infernal Purposes.
As soon as the Bargain was concluded,
the Devil was said to deliver to the Witch an Imp
or familiar Spirit, to be ready at call, and to do
whatever it was directed. By the Aid of this
Imp and the Devil together, the Witch, who was
almost always an old Woman, was enabled to
transport herself through the Air on a Broom-stick
or a Spit, and to transform herself into
various Shapes, particularly those of Cats and
Hares; to inflict Diseases on whomsoever she
pleased, and to punish her Enemies in a Variety
of Ways. The Belief of Witchcraft is very ancient.
It was universally believed in Europe till
the 16th Century, and even maintained its Ground
with tolerable Firmness till the Middle of the
17th Century. Vast Numbers of reputed Witches
were condemned to be burned every Year, so that
in England alone it is computed that no fewer
than 30,000 of them suffered at the Stake."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>

Dr. Ogilvie closes his Definition with one Extract
from Shakespeare:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i6">"He hath a Witchcraft</div>
<div class="i0">Over the King in's Tongue."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>It cannot be denied that the Existence of
Witchcraft is as fully taught in the Bible as
Slavery. The Light of Science has extinguished
the one, while the other yet struggles against
Fate.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> To urge the Authority of the Bible, that
Slavery is a divine Institution, and therefore should
be sustained, is just as reasonable as it would be to
urge the Existence of Witches; and were there
as many Interests at Stake in keeping alive Witchcraft,
it would find as many Advocates, doubtless,
as Slavery.</p>

<p>At first, Voices against Witchcraft were faint
and few. Such was the Bewilderment of the
human Mind in early Ages that Men hardly
dared to think in Opposition to the Superstitions
of the Multitude. Yet there were always some
who doubted the delegated Power of the Devil,
though they were not often lavish enough of
their own Safety to let their Disbelief be known.
Still, there are, no Doubt, some "dark Corners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>
of the Earth" where it would not be entirely
safe for one to declare publicly that there is no
such Matter as Witchcraft. Nor is this so much
to be wondered at, when, at the present Day, and
in a Portion of our own Country, a Man cannot
speak against Slavery, but at the Peril of his Life.
This is no new Aspect growing out of the present
Rebellion, but it has been thus many Years.</p>

<p>Few Men dared to speak boldly against the
Existence of Witchcraft before the Year 1700.
Though they disbelieved in it they were afraid to
attack it. They began by endeavouring to show
the Insufficiency of the Evidence relied upon in
particular Cases. In this Way, Frauds were detected
and exposed, and the Eyes of Judges were
opened.</p>

<p>Among the early and successful Combatants of
Witchcraft in England was Sir Robert Filmer.
This Gentleman, though he out-went Machiavel
himself in Arguments to uphold Despotism, yet
he entered a pretty effectual Demurrer against the
Prerogative of the Devil, as attempted to be manifested
in the Persons of aged Matrons. Lancashire
was distinguished above all other Counties
in England in Sir Robert's Time for its Production
of Witches; but when his native County,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>
Kent, was scourged by the imaginary Arts of
Satan, he thought it Time to make a public
Declaration of his Views in Regard to the Nature
of the Evidence made Use of for the Conviction
of Witches. He therefore prepared a
Treatise which he entitled "An Advertisement to
the Jury-men of England, touching Witches,"
printed in 1680, but whether it was ever printed
before does not appear from this Impression. In
this Work he criticises the Productions of some
of the prominent Authors in Favor of Witchcraft
with much Ability.</p>

<p>To the Assertion that Witches act under a
Contract with the Devil, Mr. Filmer observes,
"That the Agreement between the Witch and
the Devil they call a Covenant, and yet neither
of the Parties are any Way bound to perform
their Part; and the Devil, without Doubt, notwithstanding
all his Craft, hath far the worst
Part of the Bargain. The Bargain runs thus in
Master Perkins's Work: 'The Witch as a Slave
binds herself by Vow to believe in the Devil, and
to give him either Body, or Soul, or both, under
his Hand-writing, or some Part of his Blood.
The Devil promiseth to be ready at his Vassal's
Command, to appear in the Likeness of any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>
Creature, to consult and to aid him for the procuring
of Pleasure, Honor, Wealth, or Preferment;
to go for him, to carry him any whither,
and to do any Command.' Whereby we see the
Devil is not to have Benefit of his Bargain till the
Death of the Witch. In the Meantime, he is to
appear always at the Witche's Command, to go
for him [or her], to carry him any whither, and
to do any Command; which argues the Devil to
be the Witche's Slave, and not the Witch the
Devil's Slave. And though it be true which
Delrio affirmeth, 'That the Devil is at Liberty to
perform or break his Compact, for that no Man
can compel him to keep his Promise;' yet on the
other Side, it is as possible for the Witch to frustrate
the Devil's Contract, if he or she have so
much Grace as to repent; the which there may
be good Cause to do, if the Devil be found not to
perform his Promise. Besides, a Witch may
many Times require that to be done by the Devil,
which God permits not the Devil to do; thus
against his Will the Devil may lose his Credit,
and give Occasion of Repentance, though he
endeavor to the utmost of his Power to bring to
pass whatsoever he hath promised; and so fail of
the Benefit of his Bargain, though he have the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span>
Hand-writing, or some Part of the Blood of the
Witch for his Security, or the Solemnity before
Witnesses, as Delrio imagineth."</p>

<p>Thus much is given to show in what Manner
the Advocates of Witchcraft were combatted,
without denying the actual Existence of it. It
was as much as could be safely advanced in the
seventeenth Century. To have come out boldly,
and denied the Thing altogether, would have
been to proclaim a Disbelief of the Teachings of
the Bible; and this would have defeated the very
Object sought to be attained. It has, beyond
Question, occurred to all thinking Men in every
Age, that Witches and Devils could not have a
Being without God's Permission; that if they did
or do exist, it is his Pleasure that they should;
that, therefore, if God wished to destroy such Miscreants
he would do it by making War on them
himself, instead of compelling Mankind to fight
them blindfolded for all Eternity, or during the
World's Existence.</p>

<p>There are few Readers probably who have not
heard of a Book upon Witchcraft by a royal
Hand&mdash;a King of England. James I wrote a
Book to which he gave the Title, <i>Dæmonologie</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span>
To those who have not studied the State of Society
in England for a Century or so before the
Emigration of our Fathers to New England, and
consequently cannot comprehend the Kind and
Degree of Knowledge and Intelligence possessed
by the People; it will seem incredible how they
were bound down by such childish and utterly
puerile Stuff as was put forth by James in his
Work on Witchcraft. Nursery Tales of a later
Day are quite as easily believed to be realities as
the Witch Stories of a former Age, and the Allegories
of Bunyan are much easier transformed
to Realities. That so weak and absurd a Production
as the <i>Dæmonologie</i> reflects the Understanding
and Literature of our Fathers, must be not a little
humiliating to their Descendants to the latest Posterity.
The <i>Dæmonologie</i> was printed at Edinburgh,
in Quarto, six Years before James came to
the Crown of England, namely, in 1593. His
Work corresponded with the Times in which it
was written. Here is a Specimen of its Contents:
"The Devil teaches Witches how to make Pictures
of Wax and Clay, that by the roasting
thereof, the Persons that they bear the Name of,
may be continually melted or dried away by continual
Sickness ... not that any of these
Means which he teacheth them (except Poisons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span>
which are composed of Things natural) can of
themselves help any to these Turns they are imployed
in.... That Witches can bewitch,
and take the Life of Men or Women by roasting
of the Pictures [Images] which is very possible to
their Master to perform; for although that Instrument
of Wax have no Virtue in the Turn
doing, yet may he not very well, by that same
Measure that his conjured Slave melts that Wax
at the Fire, may he not, I say, at these same
Times, subtilly as a Spirit, so weaken and scatter
the Spirits of Life of the Patient, as may make
him on the one Part for Faintness to sweat out
the Humours of his Body; and on the other
Part, for the not concurring of these Spirits which
cause his Digestion, so debilitate his Stomach,
that his Humour radical continually sweating out
on the one Part, and no new good Suck being
put in the Place thereof for Lack of Digestion on
the other, he at last shall vanish away even as his
Picture will do at the Fire."</p>

<p>The Reader will hardly desire any more from
such a royal Source; but even royal Nonsense may
sometimes be Necessary upon historical Points,
and we must listen to their incoherent Jargon,
however much we hold them in Contempt. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</a></span>
was during the Reign of this King that New
England began to be settled, and the Settlers were
his Subjects, and with them came the Superstitions
common to the People of England.</p>

<p>In James's Book he lays down Rules for determining
who were Witches, and great Numbers
were executed in Pursuance of those Rules. No
sooner was that benighted King seated upon the
English Throne, but the following Statute was
passed: "If any Person or Persons shall use, practice,
or exercise any Invocation, or Conjuration of
any evil and wicked Spirit, or shall consult, covenant
with, entertain, employ, feed or reward any
evil and wicked Spirit, to or for any Intent and
Purpose: or take up any dead Man, Woman or
Child, out of his, her or their Grave, or any other
Place where the dead Body resteth, or the Skin,
Bone or any Part of the dead Person, to be employed
or used in any Manner of Witchcraft,
Sorcery, Charm, or Inchantment; or shall use,
practice or exercise any Witchcraft; or shall use,
practice or exercise any Witchcraft, Inchantment,
Charm or Sorcery, whereby any Person shall be
killed, destroyed, wasted, consumed, pined or
lamed in his or her Body, or any Part thereof;
that then every such Offender or Offenders, their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</a></span>
Aiders, Abettors, and Counsellors, being of any the
said Offenders duly and lawfully convicted and
attainted, shall suffer Pains of Death as a Felon or
Felons."</p>

<p>This Law does not materially differ from that
enacted in the fifth Year of Elizabeth; yet there
is a Clause in the older one, declaring that, "If
any Person shall take upon him by Witchcraft,
Inchantment, Charm or Sorcery, to tell or declare
in what Place any Treasure of Gold or Silver
should or might be found or hid in the Earth, or
other secret Places, or where Goods, or Things
lost or stolen should be found or be come: Or to
the Intent to provoke any Person to unlawful
Love, or whereby any Cattle or Goods of any
Person shall be destroyed, wasted or impaired; or
to destroy or hurt any Person in his, or her Body,
though the same be not effected, &amp;c. a Year's
Imprisonment, and Pillory, &amp;c. and the second
Conviction, Death."</p>

<p>In the early Laws of Massachusetts, adopted in
1641, Witchcraft is thus briefly dealt with: "If
any Man or Woman be a Witch (that is hath or
consulteth with a familiar Spirit) they shall be put
to Death." These Laws were called <i>The Body of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">xxv</a></span>Liberties</i>,
and were drawn up by the famous Minister
 of Boston, John Cotton. He made them
conform to the Bible, and Passages of Scripture
stand against each Law in the Margin. Against
this is found, Deut. xiii, 6, 10&mdash;xvii, 2, 6. Ex.
xxii, 20.</p>

<p>In Plymouth Colony as late as 1671, nearly the
same Law was enacted. It differed only by saying,
"If any Christian (so called) be a Witch,"
&amp;c.</p>

<p>If Sir Robert Filmer had seen our Laws, he
would, perhaps, have indulged in a few Observations
upon them. The Plymouth People seem to
have looked a little farther than the learned
Minister of Boston, as appears by the Proviso
thrown in, that a <i>Christian</i> could not be a Witch.
Of course the Judges were to determine the Point
of Christian or no Christian, assuming that a
Christian Judge could not err or be mistaken.</p>

<p>One of the Advocates of Witchcraft having
asserted that a Person cannot make the necessary
Contract with the Devil to become a Witch,
without renouncing God and Baptism, "it will
follow," says Filmer, "that none can be Witches
but such as have first been Christians. And what
shall be said then of all those idolatrous Nations,
of Lapland, Finland, and divers Parts of Africa,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</a></span>
and many other heathenish Nations, which Travellers
report to be full of Witches? And indeed,
what Need or Benefit can the Devil gain by
contracting with those Idolators, who are surer
his own than any Covenant can make them?"</p>

<p>Witchcraft, as formerly believed in, was the
Art of working Wonders or Miracles, and some
of its Expounders asserted, that the Power of effecting
Wonders does not flow from the Skill of
the Witch, but is derived wholly from the Devil,
whom the Witch has Command over, by Virtue
of a Contract. Whereupon Sir Robert Filmer
sensibly remarks, "that the Devil is really the
Worker of the Wonder, and the Witch but the
Counsellor, Persuader or Commander of it, and
only accessory before the Fact, and the Devil only
Principal. Now the Difficulty will be, how the
Accessory can be duly and lawfully convicted and
attainted according as the Statute requires, unless
the Devil, who is the Principle, be first convicted,
or at least, outlawed; which cannot be, because
the Devil can never be lawfully summoned according
to the Rules of our Common Law."</p>

<p>In this Manner Witchcraft was successfully
assailed, because it was a Species of reasoning that
did not directly interfere with the Superstitions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</a></span>
and Prejudices of the People. But the March of
Mind amongst the Masses was slow, and Trials
for Witchcraft continued in England for twenty
Years after Sir Robert Filmer wrote.</p>

<p>For one hundred Years, 1580 to 1680, in Germany
alone, 1,000 Persons a Year, on an Average,
were, upon good Authority, said to have suffered
Death for the imaginary Crime of Witchcraft.
Executions in that Country began to abate about
1694; the last Execution, being of a poor Nun,
in 1749. And it may be remarked in this Connection,
that immediately after the miserable
James published his Work on Witchcraft, 600
Persons were put to a cruel Death for being
Witches.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live," is a
Command, and it was once considered as much to
be regarded as any other Command in the Bible.
That there were Witches in the World was as
plain, and as much to be believed, as that there
were Spirits of any Kind whatever. Whoever
believed in the Immortality of the Soul, believed
in the Immortality of bad Souls as well as good.
Soul is another Word for Spirit; hence good
Spirits and bad Spirits. Witches were bad Spirits,
but whether they originated <i>in</i> Mankind, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</a></span>
whether they were sent there to take Possession of
the human Body, and to exclude a better Tenant,
has not been satisfactorily settled by Psychologists
and Metaphysicians. But one Thing seems to be
well established, and that is, that quite as many
bad Spirits find Habitations in the Sons and
Daughters of these Days, as at any former Period.
Fortunately it was found out, at length, that destroying
the Tenement of a bad Spirit, did not
destroy that Spirit. But this was not thought of
until Thousands had been put to Death.</p>

<p>It will doubtless be said by many, that if ever
there were Witches in the World, there are
Witches now. This Point it is not intended to
argue. There were always those who denied the
Existence of Witches; or, what amounted to the
same Thing, they would never allow that there
was sufficient Evidence produced to prove that
<i>Craft</i> against any who were accused of it. Persons
who thus question all Court Proceedings,
where Witchcraft was attempted to be detected,
were regarded as unfit for good Society, and unworthy
of its Protection.</p>

<p>Those who were for "ridding the Land" of
Witches, thought those who questioned the Legality
of their Proceedings, were, at least, Infidels,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">xxix</a></span>
in the most obnoxious Sense, and they were
generally treated as such, and were to be shunned
by Society. Thus it fared with <span class="smcap">Mr. Robert
Calef</span>, who, during the Prosecutions and Executions
of the People accused in Massachusetts, as
will be seen in the Progress of the present Work.</p>

<p>It is scarcely conceivable by even the partially
enlightened of the present Age, that only one
hundred and fifty Years ago our Ancestors were,
in some respects, so slightly removed from Barbarity
and heathen Darkness. Superstition will
give Way only to mental Culture; but there may
be considerable mental Culture, and also much Superstition;
for Persons may be educated in many
Things when those very Things are founded in
Error. Certain Premises are taken for granted,
because no Data exist, or at least insufficient Data,
to investigate them and the Foundations on which
they rest. This is still the Case, but it was more
so in Times past.</p>

<p>Barbarous Nations, as the Aborigines of any
Country, are Slaves to the same Kind of Superstition
as that which caused the Executions for
Witchcraft by the Governments of Old and New
England. Even many of those who opposed the
Prosecutions for that imaginary Crime, were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">xxx</a></span>
free from the same Superstitions with the Advocates
of it. They believed in Witchcraft, and
only argued the Want of Evidence against it.
This gave them a decided Disadvantage, because the
Evidence was, in many Cases, apparently so overwhelming;
insomuch, that "the learned Baxter"
wrote to Dr. Increase Mather, declaring, "The
Evidence is so convincing, that he must be a very
obdurate Sadducee who will not believe it."
Hence if there were some Persons who did not
believe the strange and unnatural Things alleged
to have been performed by Persons charged with
Witchcraft they were treated as "obdurate Sadducees,"
whose Unbelief was only a Pretence.
Times have so much changed, that it is not necessary
to make the Admissions which the Opposers
of Witchcraft formerly made. Then, to
deny the Existence of it was precisely the same
as to deny that the Bible was a Revelation from
God. Therefore, as was before observed, those
who opposed the Prosecutions for Witchcraft,
labored under a great Disadvantage. The Belief
in it being nearly universal, the solitary Individual
who dared to stem so popular a Torrent, now
looked upon clearly as a Delusion, had nothing to
expect on all Hands, but Obloquy, Derision and
Contempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">xxxi</a></span>

From all which, Nothing is easier to be discerned
than this&mdash;wherever Ignorance is the
greatest, there Superstition prevails most; that
therefore it follows of course, that Ignorance and
Superstition are the Parents of Witchcraft.</p>

<p>It never occurred to Believers in Witchcraft, it
would seem, that if Witches really existed, a Prosecution
against them could no more reach them
than it would the Air in a Bubble or the Breath
which they breathed; for if they possessed the
Power claimed for them, they also had the Power
to abandon the Bodies they possessed the Moment
it was decided to punish them in such Bodies;
and thus disconcert all Attempts to obstruct their
Craft.</p>

<p>The Advocates of Witchcraft affirm that it is
by Virtue of a League with the Devil that the
Witch is enabled to carry on her Operations; and
that the Devil, God's great Enemy, is allowed to
commission Witches, that they may also counteract
his (God's) Purposes by ensnaring Souls, as
though the Devil had not Power enough to do
the whole Mischief himself; and thus in a sneakingly
indirect Way make a Cats-paw of some
demented old Woman, or other simple Person.</p>

<p>In the midst of the Proceedings against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">xxxii</a></span>
People charged with being Witches, and while
several Jails were crowded with those unfortunate
Persons, a very serious Question arose, which, of
itself, was calculated to cause the most violent of
the Prosecutors to stay their bloody Hands, and
to ask themselves, what they had been doing?
and if, after all, there was not a Possibility that
they had been guilty of shedding innocent Blood?
The Question was a very simple and natural one,
namely, Is it not possible for a Witch to appear in
the Shape of an innocent Person? As soon as this
Question was started, there was quite a Shock in
the Community, and the Men accounted the
wisest in the Land stood still for a Time, and
looked inquiringly upon one another. As long
as the afflicted Persons accused only the Poor and
Friendless, Nothing appears to have been thought
of the Possibility that such Persons could be innocent
of the Charges preferred against them.
But, when at length, Persons considered of unblemished
Lives, standing among the first in the
Community, came to be accused, then the Case
wore a different Aspect; then it was that the before
mentioned important Question came up.
This Question divided the People, and from that
Division Safety resulted. In this Instance, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">xxxiii</a></span>
common Order of Things was reversed; Safety
came from a Division, and not from Union.
Hence a new Proverb is derived&mdash;In Union there
may be Error, while Division may elicit the
Truth.</p>

<p>The People, thus brought to a Stand, had a
little Time for reflection. This, some improved
to the Advantage of themselves, while others
improved it for the Advantage of the Public.
Some had been so strenuous in their Efforts to
convict accused Persons, that it was now very
difficult for them, even to suspend their Efforts
without giving their Opponents an immediate
Advantage over them; that even though the
Judges of the Courts who tried the accused, had
been guided mainly by "Mr. Perkins's Rules for
the Discovery of Witches," on a careful Inspection
of those Rules at this Day, it is difficult to see
how Convictions were forced out of them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, strong Ground having been taken
that Witches existed, and Persons reputed Witches
having been prosecuted with the utmost Rigor,
and unrelenting Perseverance for a long Time,
the chief Agents in these bloody Proceedings,
firm in their Convictions that they had done
righteously, deemed it incumbent upon themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">xxxiv</a></span>
to keep the People to the same Opinions. This
was the Origin of this unfortunate Book, "<i>The
Wonders of the Invisible World</i>;" the chief Part,
or perhaps all of which, was composed while
above one hundred poor People in and about Salem
and Boston were suffering a wretched imprisonment
in the filthy and barbarous Jails of those
Days, to which Jails and Prisons of our Days are
in Comparison, Palaces. It was doubtless no
sooner determined that the Proceedings against
the Witches should be given to the World, than
the Person was designated who should perform
that Service. And from the very opening of that
Work it is at once discovered, that it was intended
as a "Defence" of what had been already done,
as well as to urge a Continuance of those Proceedings,
"until the Land was fully purged of the
Demons which infested it."</p>

<p>For a long Period, the Publication of Books
detailing the Doings and Prosecutions of Witches
seems to have extended rather than abridged the
Belief in Witchcraft. This may be accounted for
in Part from the Consideration that the Teachers
of the People were themselves groveling in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">xxxv</a></span>
Mire of Superstition. A more particular Reference
to some of the Works best known somewhat
more than two Centuries ago shall here follow.</p>

<p>One Thomas Cooper published in 1617, a
Work of this Title, "The Mystery of Witchcraft.
Discouering, the Truth, Nature, Occasions,
Growth and Power thereof. Together
with the Detection and Punishment of the same.
As also, the Seuerall Stratagems of Sathan, ensnaring
the poore Soule by this desperate Practize
of annoying the Bodie: with the seueral Vses
thereof to the Church of Christ. Very necessary
for the redeeming of these atheisticall and secure
Times."</p>

<p>This Author dedicated his Work to the "Maior
and Corporation of the Ancient Citie of Chester,"
&amp;c., in which Dedication we find the following,
which, throwing some Light on the reverend
Dealer in Darkness, is extracted. He commences,
"Diuers, and verie weighty haue been
the Motiues (right Worshipfull) to induce mee
to the Dedication of these my Labors in this
kinde vnto your Worships.</p>

<p>"The first is, because my first Calling from
the Vniversitie, to employ my Ministrie for the
Edification of the Saints, was by the Gouernors of
your famous Citie, to succeed that painefull and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">xxxvi</a></span>
profitable Teacher, Maister Harrison, who was
thence called by the King's most Excellent Maiestie,
to be one of the sixe Teachers to those
barren and needfull Places of the Country of
Lancashire. And therefore, hauing both kind
intertainment among you; and by some of you
being furthered to a more settled Pastorall Charge
in that Countie, I could not but leave some Memoriall
of my Thankefulnesse vnto you herein.</p>

<p>"Secondly, my free Admission to that Pastorall
Charge, together with the singular Providence of
God, in directing my Ministrie for the informing
and reforming of that ignorant People, who never
before enioyed any constant Ministrie, as also his
admirable Protection and Deliuerance of me from
vnreasonable Men, that vsed all their Force and
Cunning to hinder the Proceedings of the Gospel
of Christ."</p>

<p>These Extracts are made because they give a
Glimpse of the Life and Character of an Author,
second only to King James as a Cultivator of
Witchcraft. His Book is a small Duodecimo of
368 Pages, in the Close of which he says, "to the
wise and humble Reader, I am not ashamed to
acknowledge, that which thou canst not but discerne;
that I have borrowed most of my Grounds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">xxxvii</a></span>
from his Maiesties Dæmonologie, Mr. Perkins,
Mr. Gifford, and others." And this truly may
be added, "the Blind were led by the Blind," in
the fullest Sense of the Maxim. Master Cooper
further remarks upon the Labors of his royal
Predecessor and others in these Words, "they
have waded before mee heerein, to confirme the
Authoritie thereof, against the Atheisme of these
evill Dayes: that so each might have the perfect
Honour of their owne Paines."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In his second Chapter he says, "it is proued
that there haue beene, are, and shall be Witches
to the World's End: both by sound Testimony,
1st, from the Word; 2d, from Antiquity; 3d,
from pregnant Reasons, and so such Obiections
answered, as seeme to contradict this Truth."</p>

<p>This most singularly superstitious Writer says
there were good Witches as well as bad ones;
that these good Witches are called the <i>unbinding</i>
ones; because they undo what the bad Witch
does, and yet is allowed to do good Offices with
the Consent of the Devil.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Good Witches performed wonderful Cures,
according to the Belief of those Days. Even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">xxxviii</a></span>Burton<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> says, "they can effect such Cures, the
maine Question is whether it be lawful in a desperate
Case, to crave their Help, or ask a Wizard's
Advice. 'Tis a common Practice of some Men
to go first to a Witch, and then to a Physitian.
If one cannot help the other shall." And Paracelsus
declared, "that it mattered not whether a
sick Person were helped by God or Devil, so that
he were eased." Some, however, demurred to
this, and affirmed that it was better to die than be
cured by a Witch or a Sorcerer.</p>

<p>Further to illustrate the Subject, I shall have
Recourse to Mr. Nathan Drake's <i>Shakespeare,
and his Times</i>. That chief of Expounders of
the "Immortal Bard," having had occasion to
review the Subject of Witchcraft, and having
made so clear and valuable an Analysis of it in his
Examination of the Witches of Shakespeare, as is
nowhere else to be found, I am, as will be the
Readers of this Introduction, I apprehend, fortunate
in being able to avail myself of the Labors
of that eminent Scholar and able Antiquary.</p>

<p>The Play of Macbeth is founded on a Species
of Superstition that, during the Life-time of
Shakespeare, prevailed in England and Scotland,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">xxxix</a></span>
in a Degree until then unknown. In the 33d
Year of Henry VIII, was enacted a Statute which
adjudged all Witchcraft and Sorcery to be Felony
without the Benefit of Clergy; but at the Commencement
of the Reign of Elizabeth, the Evil
seems to have been greatly on the Increase, for
Bishop Jewel, preaching before the Queen, in
1558, tells her, "It may please your Grace to understand
that Witches and Sorcerers within these
few last Years are marvelously increased within
your Grace's Realm. Your Grace's Subjects pine
away, even unto the Death, their Colour fadeth,
their Flesh rotteth, their Speech is benumbed,
their Senses are bereft, I pray God they may never
practice further then upon the Subject."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> How
prevalent the Delusion had become, in the Year
1584, we have the most ample Testimony in the
ingenious Work of Reginald Scot, entitled "The
Discoverie of Witchcraft," which was written as
the sensible and humane Author has informed us,
"in behalfe of the Poore, the Aged, and the
Simple,"<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and it reflects singular Discredit on the
Age in which it was produced, that a Detection
so complete, both with regard to Argument and
Fact, should have failed in effecting its Purpose.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">xl</a></span>
But the Infatuation had seized all Ranks, with an
Influence which rivaled that resulting from an
Article of religious Faith, and Scot begins his
Work with the Observation, that "the Fables of
Witchcraft have taken so fast hold and deepe Root
in the Heart of Man, that fewe or none can, now
adaies, with Patience indure the Hand and Correction
of God. For if any Adversitie, Greefe,
Sicknesse, Losse of Children, Corne, Cattell, or
Libertie happen unto them; by and by they exclaime
uppon Witches;&mdash;insomuch as a Clap of
Thunder, or a Gale of Wind is no sooner heard,
but either they run to ring Bells, or crie out to
burne Witches;"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and in his second Chapter, he
declares, "I have heard to my greefe some of the
Minesterie affirme, that they have had in their
Parish at one Instant xvij or xviij Witches:
meaning such as could work Miracles supernaturallie,"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
a Declaration which, in a subsequent Part
of his Book, he more particularly applies, when he
informs us, that xvij or xviij were condemned at
once at St. Osees in the County of Essex, being a
whole Parish, though of no great Quantitie."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The Mischief, however, was but in Progress,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">xli</a></span>and received a rapid Acceleration from the Publication
of the <i>Dæmonologie</i> of King James, at
Edinburgh, in the Year 1597. The Origin of
this very curious Treatise was probably laid in
the royal Mind, in Consequence of the supposed
Detection of a Conspiracy of 200 Witches with
Dr. Fian, "Register to the Devil," at their
Head, to bewitch and drown His Majesty, on his
Return from Denmark, in 1590. James attended
the Examination of these poor Wretches with
the most eager Curiosity, and the most willing
Credulity; and, when Agnis Tompson confessed,
that she, with other Witches, to the Number
just mentioned, went altogether by Sea, each one
in her Riddle, or Sieve, with Flagons of Wine,
making merry and drinking by the Way, to the
Kirk of North Berwick, in Lothian, where, when
they had landed, they took Hands and danced,
singing all with one Voice:</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Commer [Gossip] go ye before, commer goe ye</div>
<div class="i0">Gif ye will not go before, commer let me."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And "that Geilis Duncane did go before them,
playing said Reel on a Jew's Trump." James
sent for Duncane, and listened with Delight
to his Performance of the Witches' Reel on the
Jews-harp!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">xlii</a></span>

 On Agnis, however, asserting, that the Devil
had met them at the Kirk, His Majesty could
not avoid expressing some Doubts; when, taking
him aside, she "declared unto him the very
Words which had passed between him and his
Queen on the first Night of their Marriage, with
their Answer each to other; whereat the King
wondered greatly, and swore by the living God,
that he believed all the Devils in Hell could not
have discovered the same."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>That the Particulars elicited from the Confessions
of these unfortunate Beings, which, it is said,
"made the King in a wonderful Admiration,"
formed the Basis of the <i>Dæmonologie</i>, may be therefore
readily admitted. It is also to be deplored,
that, weak and absurd as this Production now appears
to us, its Effect on the Age of its Birth,
and a Century afterwards, were extensive and
melancholy in the extreme. It contributed, indeed,
more than any other Work on the Subject,
to rivet the Fetters of Credulity; and scarcely had
a twelve month elapsed from its Publication, before
its Result was visible in the Destruction in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">xliii</a></span>Scotland, of not less than 600 human Beings at
once, for this imaginary Crime!<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The Succession of James to the Throne of
Elizabeth served but to propagate the Contagion;
for no sooner had he reached this Country, than
his Dæmonologie reappeared from an English
Press, being printed in London, in 1603, in
Quarto, and with a Preface to the Reader, which
commences by informing him of the "fearfull
abounding at this Time in this Country, of these
detestable Slaves of the Devel, the Witches, or
Enchanters;"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> a Declaration which, during the
Course of the same Year, was accompanied by a
new Statute against Witches, one Clause of which
enacts, that, "Any one that shall use, practice, or
exercise any Invocation or Conjuration of any
evill or wicked Spirit, or consult, covenant with,
entertaine or employ, feede or reward, any evill
or wicked Spirit, to or for any Intent or Purpose;
or take up any dead Man, Woman or Child, out
of his, her, or their Grave, or any other Place
where the dead Body resteth, or the Skin, Bone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">xliv</a></span>or other Part of any dead Person, to be employed
or used in any Manner of Witchcraft, Sorcery,
Charme, or Enchantment; or shall use, practice,
or exercise any Witchcraft, Enchantment,
Charme, or Sorcery, whereby any Person shall
be killed, destroyed, wasted, consumed, pined, or
lamed, in his or her Body, or any Part thereof,
such Offenders, duly and lawfully convicted and
attainted, shall suffer Death."</p>

<p>This Act was not repealed until the Year 1736.
(ix Geo. II.)</p>

<p>We cannot wonder if Measures such as those,
which stamped the already existing Superstitions
with the renewed Authority of the Law, and
with the Influence of regal Argument and Authority,
should render a Belief in the Existence
of Witchcraft almost universal; Fashion and Interest
on the one Hand, and Ignorance and Fear
on the other, mutually contributing, by concealing
and banishing Doubt, to disseminate Error,
and preclude Detection.</p>

<p>Who those were who, at this Period, had the
Misfortune to be branded with the Appellation
of Witches; what Deeds were imputed to them,
and what was the Nature of their supposed Compact
with the Devil, are Questions which will
be most satisfactorily answered in the Words of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">xlv</a></span>
Reginald Scot, whose Book is not only extremely
scarce, but highly curious and entertaining; and
two or three Chapters from this copious Treasury
of Superstition, with a very few Comments from
other Sources, will exhaust this Part of the Subject.</p>

<p>"The Sort of such as are said to be Witches,"
writes Scot, "are Women which be commonly
old, lame, bleare-eied, pale, fowle, and full of
Wrinkles; poore, sullen, Superstitious, and Papists;
or such as know no Religion; in whose
drousie Minds the Divell hath gotten a fine Seat;
so as, what Mischeefe, Mischance, Calamitie, or
Slaughter is brought to passe, they are easilie persuaded
the same is doone by themselves; imprinting
in their Minds an earnest and constant
Imagination thereof. They are leane and deformed,
shewing Melancholie in their Faces, to
the Horror of all that see them. They are
doting, Scolds, mad, develish, and not much
differing from them that are thought to be
possessed with Spirits; so firme and stedfast in
their Opinions, as whosoever shall onelie have
respect to the Constancie of their Words uttered,
would easilie beleeve they were true indeed.</p>

<p>"These miserable Wretches are so odious unto
all their Neighbors, and so feared, as few dare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">xlvi</a></span>
offend them, or denie them anie Thing they
aske: whereby they take upon them; yea, and
some Times thinke, that they can doo such
Things as are beyond the Abilitie of humane
Nature. These go from House to House, and
from Doore to Doore for a Pot full of Milke,
Yest, Drinke, Pottage, or some such Reelefe;
without the which they could hardlie live:
neither obtaining for their Service and Paines,
nor by their Art, nor yet at the Divels Hands
(with whome they are said to make a perfect and
visible Bargaine) either Beautie, Monie, Promotion,
Welth, Worship, Pleasure, Honor, Knowledge,
Learning, or any other Benefit whatsoever.</p>

<p>"It falleth out many Times, that neither their
Necessities, nor their Expectation is answered or
served, in those Places where they beg or borrowe;
but ratheir Kindness is by their Neighbors
reproved. And further, in Tract of Time the
Witch weareth odious and tedious to her Neighbors;
and they againe are despised and despited
of hir; so as sometimes she curseth one, and
sometimes another; and that from the Maister of
the House, his Wife, Children, Cattell, &amp;c. to
the little Pig that lieth in the Stie. Thus in
Processe of Time they have all displeased hir, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">xlvii</a></span>
she hath wished evil Luck unto them all; perhaps
with Curses and Imprecations made in
Forme. Doubtless (at Length) some of hir
Neighbors die, or falle sicke; or some of their
Children are visited with Diseases that ver them
strangelie: as Apoplexies, Epilepsies, Convulsions,
hot Fevers, Wormes, &amp;c. Which by ignorant
Parents are supposed to be the Vengeance of
Witches. Yea and their Opinions and Conceits
are confirmed and maintained by unskilfull
Physicians: according to the common Saieng;
<i>Inscitiæ Pallium Maleficium et Incantatio</i>, Witchcraft
and Inchantment is the Cloke of Ignorance:
whereas indeed evill Humors, and not strange
Words, Witches, or Spirits are the Causes of such
Diseases. Also some of their Cattell perish,
either by Disease or Mischance. Then they,
upon whom such Adversities fall, weighing the
Fame that goeth upon this Woman (hir Words,
Displeasure, and Curses meeting so justly with
their Misfortune) doo not onlie conceive, but are
resolved, that all their Mishaps are brought to
passe by hir onelie Means.</p>

<p>"The Witch on the other Side expecting hir
Neighbors Mischances, and seeing Things sometimes
come to passe according to hir Wishes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">xlviii</a></span>
Curses, and Incantations (for Bodin himself confesseth,
that not above two in a hundred of their
Witchings or Wishings take effect) being called
before a Justice, by due Examination of the Circumstances
is driven to see hir Imprecations and
Desires, and hir Neighbors Harmes and Losses to
concurre, and as it were to take effect: and so
confesseth that she (as a Goddes) hath brought
such Things to passe. Wherein, not onelie she,
but the Accuser, and also the Justice are fowlie
deceived and abused; as being thorough hir Confession
and other Circumstances persuaded (to the
Injury of Gods Glorie) that she hath doone, or
can doo that which is proper onelie to God
himselfe.</p>

<p>"Another Sort of Witches there are, which be
absolutelie Cooseners: These take upon them,
either for Glorie, Fame, or Gaine, to doo any
Thing, which God or the Divell can doo: either
for fortelling Things to come, bewraieng of
Secrets, curing of Maladies, or working of Miracles."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>To this Chapter from Scot, which we have
given entire, may be added the admirable Description
of the Abode of a Witch from the Pen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">xlix</a></span>of Spenser, who as Warton hath observed, copied
from living Objects, and had probably been
struck with seeing such a Cottage, in which a
Witch was supposed to live:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"There is a gloomy hollow Glen she found</div>
<div class="i0">A little Cottage built of Sticks and Reeds</div>
<div class="i0">In homely wise, and walled with Sods around;</div>
<div class="i0">In which a Witch did dwell, in loathly Weedes.</div>
<div class="i0">And wilful Want, all carelesse of her Needes</div>
<div class="i0">So choosing solitarie to abide</div>
<div class="i0">Far from all Neighbours, that her divilish Deeds</div>
<div class="i0">And hellish Arts from People she might hide,</div>
<div class="i0">And hurt far off unknowne whomever she enviede."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>This very striking Picture forever fixed the
Character of the Habitation allotted to a Witch;
thus in a singularly curious Tract, entitled,
"Round about our Coal-Fire," published about
the Close of the seventeenth Century, and which
details, in a pleasing Manner, the Tradition of
the olden Time, as a Source of Christmas Amusement,
it is said that "a Witch must be a hagged
old Woman, living in a little rotten Cottage,
under a Hill, by a Wood-side, and must be frequently
spinning at the Door: she must have a
black Cat, two or three Broom-sticks, an Imp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">l</a></span>or two, and two or three diabolical Teats to
suckle her Imps."</p>

<p>Of the wonderful Feats which the various
Kinds of Witches were supposed capable of performing,
Scott has favored us with the following
succinct Enumeration. There are three Sorts of
Witches he tells us, "one Sort can hurt and not
helpe, the second can helpe and not hurt, the
third can both helpe and hurt. Among the
hurtfull Witches there is one Sort more beastlie
than any Kind of Beasts, saving Wolves: for
these usually devour and eate young Children and
Infants of their owne Kind. These be they that
raise Haile, Tempests, and hurtfull Weather; as
Lightning, Thunder, &amp;c. These be they that
procure Barrennesse in Man, Woman and Beast.
These can throwe Children in Waters, as they
walk with their Mothers, and not be seene.
These can make Horses kicke, till they cast their
Riders. These can pass from Place to Place in
the Aire invisible. These can so alter the Mind
of Judges, that they can have no Power to hurt
them. These can procure to themselves and to
others, Taciturnitie and Insensibilitie in their
Torments. These can bring trembling to the
Hands, and strike Terror into the Minds of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">li</a></span>
that apprehend them. These can manifest unto
others, Things hidden and lost, and foreshow
Things to come; and see them as though they
were present. These can alter Men's Minds to
inordinate Love or Hate. These can kill whom
they list with Lightning and Thunder. These
can take away Man's Courage. These can make
a Woman miscarrie in Childbirth, and destroie
the Child in the Mother's Wombe, without any
sensible Means either inwardlie or outwardlie
applied. These can with their Looks kill either
Man or Beast.</p>

<p>"Others doo write, that they can pull downe
the Moone and the Starres. Some write that
with wishing they can send Needles into the
Livers of their Enemies. Some that they can
transferre Corne in the Blade from one Place to
another. Some, that they can cure Diseases supernaturallie,
flie in the Aire, and danse with
Divels. Some write, that they can play the Part
of <i>Succubus</i>, and contract themselves to <i>Incubus</i>.
Some saie they can transubstantiate themselves
and others, and take the Forms and Shapes
of Asses, Woolves, Ferrets, Cowes, Asses, Horses,
Hogs, &amp;c. Some say they can keepe Divels and
Spirits in the Likenesse of Todes and Cats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">lii</a></span>

 They can raise Spirits (as others affirme), drie
up Springs, turn the Course of running Waters,
inhibit the same, and staie both Day and Night,
changing the one into the other. They can go
in and out at Awger Holes, and saile in an Egge
Shell, a Cockle or Muscle Shell, through and
under the tempestuous Seas. They can bring
Soules out of the Graves. They can teare Snakes
in Pieces. They can also bring to pass, that
Churne as long as you list, your Butter will not
come; <i>especially, if either the Maids have eaten up
the Cream; or the Good-wife have sold the Butter
before in the Market</i>."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The only material Accession which the royal
James has made to this curious Catalogue of the
Deeds of Witchcraft, consists in informing us,
that these aged and decrepid Slaves of Satan,
"make Picture of Waxe and Clay, that by the
roasting thereof, the Persons that they bear the
Name of, may be continually melted or dried
away by continuall Sicknesse;"<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and his Mode
of explaining how the Devil performs this Marvel,
is a notable Instance both of his Ingenuity
and his Eloquence. This Deed, he says, "is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">liii</a></span>verie possible to their Master to performe; for
although that Instrument of Waxe have no Vertue
in that Turne doing, yet may he not very
well, even by the same Measure, that his conjured
Slaves melt that Waxe at the Fire, may be not,
I say, at these same Times, subtily, as a Spirit, so
weaken and scatter the Spirits of Life of the Patient,
as may make him on the one Part, for
Faintnesse, to sweat out the Humour of his Bodie,
and on the other Part, for the not Concurrence
of these Spirits, which causes his Digestion, so
debilitate his stomache that this Humour radicall
continually, sweating out on the one Part, and
no newe good sucke being put in the Place thereof,
for Lacke of Digestion on the other, he at last
shall vanish away, even as his Picture will doe at
the Fire? And that knavish and cunning Workman,
by troubling him onely at sometimes,
makes a Proportion, so neere betwixt the working
of the one and <span class="err" title="original: rhe">the</span> other, that both shall end
as it were at one Time."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>It remains to notice the Nature of the Compact
or Bargain, which Witches were believed to
enter into with their Seducer, and the Species of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">liv</a></span>Homage which they were compelled to pay
him; and here again we must have Recourse to
Scot, not only as the most compressed, but as the
most authentic Detailer of this strange Credulity
of his Times. "The Order of their Bargaine or
profession," says he, "is double; the one solemne
and publike; the other secret and private. That
which is called solemne or publike, is where
Witches come together at certaine Assemblies,
at the Times prefixed, and doo not onelie see the
Divell in visible Forme; but confer and talke
familiarlie with him. In which Conference the
Divell exhorteth them to observe their Fidelitie
unto him, promising them long Life and Prosperitie.
Then the Witches assembled, commanded
a new Disciple (whom they call a Novice)
unto him: and if the Divell find that young
Witch apt and forward in the Renunciation of
christian Faith, in despising anie of the seven
Sacraments, in treading upon Crosses, in spetting
at the Time of the Elevation, in breaking their
Fast on fasting Daies, and fasting on Sundaies:
then the Devill giveth foorth his Hand, and the
Novice joining Hand in Hand with him, promiseth
to observe and keepe all the Divels Commandments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">lv</a></span>

 "This doone, the Divell beginneth to be more
bold with hir, telling her plainlie, that all this
will not serve his Turne: and therefore requireth
Homage at hir Hands: yea he also telleth hir,
that she must grant him both hir Bodie and Soule
to be tormented in everlasting Fire; which she
yeeldeth unto. Then he chargeth hir to procure
as manie Men, Women and Children also,
as she can, to enter into this Societie. Then he
teacheth them to make Ointments of the Bowels
and Members of Children, whereby they ride in
the Aire, and accomplish all their Desires. So
as if there be anie Children unbaptized, or not
garded by the Signe of the Crosse, or Orisons;
then the Witches may and do catche them from
their Mother's Sides in the Night, or out of their
Cradles, or otherwise kill them with their Ceremonies;
and after Buriall steale them out of their
Graves, and seeth them in a Caldron, until their
Flesh be made potable. Of the thickest whereof
they make Ointments, whereby they ride in the
Aire; but the thinner Potion they put into Flaggons,
whereof whosoever drinketh, observing
certain Ceremonies, immediatelie becometh a
Maister or rather a Mistresse in that Practice and
Facultie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">lvi</a></span>

 "Their Homage with their Oth and Bargaine
is received for a certeine Terme of Yeares;
sometimes forever. Sometimes it consisteth in
the Deniall of the whole Faith, sometimes in
Part. And this is doone either by Oth, Protestation
of Words, or by Obligation in writing,
sometimes sealed with Wax, sometimes signed
with Blood, sometimes by kissing the Divel's
bare Buttocks.</p>

<p>"You must also understand, that after they
have delicatelie banketted with the Divell and
the Ladie of the Fairies; and have eaten up a fat
Oxe, and emptied a Butt of Malmesie, and a
Binne of Bread at some noble Man's House, in
the Dead of the Night, nothing is missed of all
this in the Morning. For the Ladie <i>Sibylla</i>,
<i>Minerva</i>, or <i>Diana</i>, with a golden Rod striketh
the Vessel and the Binne, and they are fully replenished
againe." After mentioning that the
Bullock is restored in the same magical Manner,
he states it as an "infallible Rule, that everie
Fortnight, or at least everie Month, each Witch
must kill one Child at the least for hir Part."
He also relates from Bodin, that "at these magicall
Assemblies, the Witches never faile to dance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">lvii</a></span>
and whiles they sing and danse, everie one hath
a broome in hir Hand, and holdeth it up aloft."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>To these Circumstances attending the Meetings
of this unhallowed Sisterhood, King James
adds, that Satan, in Order that "hee may the
more vively counterfeit and scorne God, oft
Times makes his Slaves to conveene in those very
Places, which are destinate and ordained for the
conveening of the Servants of God (I meane by
Churches):&mdash;further, Witches oft times confesse,
not only his conveening in the Church with
them, but his occupying of the Pulpit."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> For
this Piece of Information James seems to have
been indebted to the Confessions of Agnis Tompson;
but he also relates, that the Devil, as soon
as he has induced his Votaries to renounce their
God and Baptism, "gives them his Marke upon
some secret Place of their Bodie, which remaines
soare unhealed, whilest his next Meeting with
them, and thereafter ever insensible, however it
be nipped or pricked by any;" a Seal of Destinction
which, he tells us at the Close of his
Treatise, is of great Use in detecting them on
their Trial, as "the finding of their Marke, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">lviii</a></span>the trying the Insensiblenes thereof," was considered
as a positive Proof of their Craft. His
Majesty, however, proceeds to mention another
Mode of ascertaining their Guilt, terminating the
Paragraph in a Manner not very flattering to his
female Subjects, or very expressive of his own
Gallantry. "The other is," he tells us, "their
fleeting on the Water: for as in a secret Murther,
if the dead Carkase bee at any Time thereafter
handled by the Murtherer, it will gush out
of Blood, as if the Blood were crying to the
Heaven for Revenge of the Murtherer, God
having appointed that secret supernaturall Signe,
for Triall of that secret unnaturall Crime, so it
appears that God hath appointed (for a supernaturall
Signe of the monstrous Impietie of
Witches) that the Water shall refuse to receive
them in her Bosome, that have shaken off them
the sacred Water of Baptisme, and wilfully refused
the Benefite thereof: No, not so much as
their Eyes are able to shed Teares (threaten and
torture them as you please) while first they repent
(God not permitting them to dissemble
their Obstinacie in so horrible a Crime) albeit
the Women-kind especially, be able otherwayes
to shed Teares at every light Occasion when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">lix</a></span>
will, yea, although it were dissembling like the
Crocodiles."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Such are the chief Features of this gross Superstition,
as detailed by the Writers of the
Period in which it most prevailed in this Country.
<i>Scot</i> has taken infinite Pains in collecting,
from every Writer on the Subject, the <i>minutiæ</i> of
Witchcraft, and his Book is expanded to a thick
Quarto, in Consequence of his commenting at
large on the Particulars which he had given in
his initiatory Chapters, for the Purpose of their
complete Refutation and Exposure; a Work of
great Labor, and which shows, at every Step,
how deeply this Credulity had been impressed on
the Subjects of Elizabeth. <i>James</i>, on the other
Hand, though a Man of considerable Erudition,
and, in some respects, of shrewd, good Sense,
wrote in Defence of this Folly, and, unfortunately
for Truth and Humanity, the Doctrine of
the Monarch was preferred to that of the Sage.</p>

<p>Fortunately the Time has arrived when the
Belief of a King, or that of any other titled Personage,
has very little Effect in fastening upon the
World at large any peculiar Opinions he may
have formed upon any Subject not within the
Province of Reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">lx</a></span>
 Spiritualists and the Disciples of Mesmer have
made the Discovery that Witchcraft is fully explained
by one or the other of the Mysteries taught
by them. How much Truth there may be in the
Assertion I cannot undertake to determine. But
from a very limited Acquaintance with Mysteries
in general, my Opinion is that the Application of
Mesmerism for the Explanation of Witchcraft,
would partake very much of the Nature of
applying one Absurdity to the Explanation of
another.</p>

<p>For the "thousand and one" Examples of
Witchcraft practiced by accused Persons in New
England, an almost exact Parallel may be found
in Cases which had previously occurred in Old
England. And, in Proportion to the Number
of Inhabitants in the respective Countries, there
were as many in New as in Old England who
raised their Voices against Prosecutions for the
supposed Crime. Hence it is very obvious that
mental Darkness was as dense in Old as in New
England, at the Time of the Delusions of which
we are speaking.</p>

<p>Superstition was then bounded only by the
Limits of what was termed Civilization. The
Light of Science for the last two hundred Years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">lxi</a></span>
has considerably relieved Mankind from that
deadly Incubus, and it is gratifying to believe that
the March of Mind is onward and that a future
of pure Light is before the World of Humanity.
Like dark Spots on a Planet, some Superstitions
seem almost as unaccountable, and their Removal
appears about as difficult, so long have we been
accustomed to tolerate them.</p>

<p>As late as 1668 it was asserted by an eminent
English Writer, a Member of the Royal Society,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
that "<i>Atheism</i> is begun in <i>Saducism</i>. And those
that dare not bluntly say, <i>There</i> is NO GOD,
content themselves, (for a fair <i>Step</i>, and <i>Introduction</i>)
to deny there are SPIRITS, or WITCHES.
Which Sort of <i>Infidels</i>, though they are not ordinary
among the <i>meer vulgar</i>, yet are they
numerous in a little higher Rank of <i>Understandings</i>.
And those that know anything of the
World, know, that most of the looser <i>Gentry</i>, and
the small Pretenders to <i>Philosophy</i> and <i>Wit</i>, are
generally Deriders of the <i>Belief</i> of <i>Witches</i>, and
<i>Apparitions</i>."</p>

<p>Hence there were but two Horns to the Dilemma
in which every one found himself&mdash;he
must believe in Witchcraft and all the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">lxii</a></span>degrading Attendants on that Belief, or he must
be viewed and scorned as an Atheist, and as an
Unbeliever in everything that was good!</p>

<p>It was difficult for People to distinguish between
Miracles and Witchcraft, especially when
the most learned Men,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> in Order to make the
Miracle of the Ascent of the Saviour appear
reasonable, argued that "He went as far towards
Heaven as he could on Foot, even to the Top of
Mount Olivet." And when Elijah was to fast
forty Days, "that there might be no Waste of
miraculous Power, God would have him eat a
double Meal before entering upon the Term of
fasting!" With such wretched Absurdities were
the Minds of People of that Time enslaved.
The Superstitions of the Greeks and Romans
were not greater. And although there is a
steady Progress in intellectual Improvement, and
a Time is believed to be approaching when the
World will be as free from the Cheats and Impostures
of the present Day, as some of the
present Day are of those of previous Ages; yet it
is in a Measure discouraging, when we see the
Thousands ensnared by such transparent Jugglery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">lxiii</a></span>as that which has peopled the Salt Lake Regions,
and drawn other Thousands in our Midst to witness
Feats that never did nor never will happen,
except in the deluded Brains of those who desire
to be thus deluded.</p>

OTTON <span class="smcap">Mather</span> was born in Boston,
February 12th, 1662-3. In his
Youth he was remarkable for his
Progress in Knowledge, and soon became
extensively known for his varied
Acquirements. At the Age of Twelve he
entered Harvard College, and graduated in
due Course. He was thrice married: 1st,
when in his twenty-fourth Year, to Abigail,
Daughter of Col. John Phillips, of Charlestown;
2d, to Widow Elizabeth Hubbard, Daughter of
Dr. John Clark; and 3d, to Lydia, Widow of Mr.
John George, Daughter of the Rev. Samuel Lee,
sometime of Bristol in Rhode Island. By the
last Wife he had no Children, but by the others
he had fifteen, nine of which were by the first.</p>

<p>The Father of Mr. Mather was Dr. Increase
Mather, Pastor of the North Church, of Boston,
of whom the Biographer of the former remarks,
that, "as President of Harvard College, by whose
printed composures both Latin and English, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">lxvi</a></span>
by whose Agency in the Courts of three Monarchs
for his afflicted Country, have rendered
him universally known."</p>

<p>His Mother was Maria, Daughter of Mr.
John Cotton of Boston, a Name as intimately
associated with the History of New England as
any other. And judging from the Portraits of
the Grandsire and Grandson, there was a very
strong Resemblance of the one to the other.</p>

<p>Mr. Mather began to preach in 1680, and his
first Sermon was delivered in Dorchester, on the
22d of August of that Year. In the following
February he was invited to become an Assistant
to his Father in the North Church in Boston,
which Invitation he accepted. About two Years
later he was unanimously chosen Pastor by the
same Church, but was not ordained until May,
1684; his Ordination probably being deferred on
Account of his Youth; being at the Time of his
Ordination but twenty-one Years and three
Months old. On that Occasion he received the
Right Hand of Fellowship from the venerable
Mr. John Eliot, of Roxbury.</p>

<p>At an early Age he began to keep a Diary,
and from the Passages we have from it we are
convinced that its Entries were dictated by an
honest Mind, and that Duplicity and evil Intentions
could never find an abiding Place therein;
that his sole Aim was Goodness, and a strong
Desire to lead a life of Purity, is manifest
throughout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">lxvii</a></span>

Mr. Mather commenced Author at the Age
of 23, and continued his Publications to the Year
of his Decease; extending over a Period of about
forty-two Years. In that Time he is said by his
Biographer to have issued 383 Books; thus
averaging about nine each Year. But many of
his <i>Books</i> would in these Days be called Pamphlets,
as they consisted of only a few Pages&mdash;a
very few indeed containing Pages sufficient to
give them the Character of a Book. A List of
these 383 Works is given in his Life by his Son,
but it is known to be incomplete. The List is
very deficient in Respect to the Titles of the
Works, also, insomuch that their Contents cannot
be determined from them.</p>

<p>There are several Biographies of Dr. Cotton
Mather, all drawn mainly from that by his Son,
Dr. Samuel Mather. An Abridgment of this
was published in England in 1744, in a small
12mo, by David Jennings. Mr. Jennings was
instigated to undertake the Abridgment by Dr.
Isaac Watts; the latter having consulted with
Mr. Mather previously, and obtained his Consent
to let his Work appear in an Abridgment. In
giving his Consent for the abridged Edition, he
thus apologizes for the original Undertaking:
"The Life of my Father, as you have it in your
Hands, was a youthful Attempt;<a name="FNanchor_26_25" id="FNanchor_26_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_25" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> though I now
plainly discern my Defects in it, and am sorry to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">lxviii</a></span>see such a Number of them, yet I can look on it
with some Comfort; partly from a Consciousness
of my honest Meaning in it, and partly because I
find several worthy Persons approve of many
Things in it, and have done me the Honour of
expressing themselves favourable about it."</p>

<p>The Mode of writing Biography has very much
changed since the Life of Dr. Mather was first
written. Those written previous to, and at that
Period, at least many of them, might be reduced
in Bulk from five to seven-eighths, without
omitting anything of Value. This Remark is
applicable to other Performances of that Time,
and to some in these as well.</p>

<p>It may be justly said of Cotton Mather, that
he was one of the most remarkable Men of the
Age in which he lived; not only remarkable on
one, but on many Accounts; and for none, perhaps,
more than for his wonderful Precociousness,
or the early Intuitiveness of his Mind.
His Memory was likewise very extraordinary.
The Acquirement of Knowledge seems to have
been with him accomplished almost without
Effort; and his Writings show that they were
generally drawn from the Storehouse of his
Mind, where, from Reading and Observation,
they had been from Time to Time deposited.
Authors who write from this Source alone are
generally diffuse, and wanting in those very essential
and minute Particulars, which in these
Days constitute so important a Part of every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">lxix</a></span>
Man's Writings. His Style is very peculiar; and
no One who is acquainted with the Writings of
"famous Thomas Fuller," can hardly doubt that
Cotton Mather attempted to make that Writer's
Composition a Model for his own. Still he falls
considerably short of Fuller in his Attempts at
witty Conceits; in them the latter is always
happy, while the former often fails.</p>

<p>His Ability for acquiring Languages has probably
been surpassed by but very few, and he is
said to have been Master of more Languages than
any other Person in New England in his Time.
Those, especially the Latin, it must be confessed,
he made a most unreasonable Use of, bringing in
Passages from them at all Times, as though every
Body understood them, as well as himself.</p>

<p>So far as we now remember, Dr. Douglass
seems to have been the Author of the Fashion or
Practice, so much of late Years in Vogue, of reviling
Cotton Mather. It has been carried to
such an Extent in some Quarters, that any One
who presumes to mention his Name, does it at
the Peril of coming in for a Share of Obloquy
and Abuse himself. Some not only charge him
with committing all Sorts of Errors and Blunders,
but they bring against him the more serious
Charge of misrepresenting Matters of Fact.
Now it would be well for those who bring those
Charges to scrutinize their own Works. It may
be, if they cannot see anything pedantic, puerile
or false in them themselves, others may come in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx">lxx</a></span>
Contact with Errors even worse than those of
Stupidity.</p>

<p>It is not to be denied that the Mind of Dr.
Mather was singularly constituted; and whoever
shall undertake an Analysis of it will find a more
difficult Task, we apprehend, than those have
found who content themselves with nothing
further than vituperative Denunciations upon its
Productions. We owe a vast Deal to Cotton
Mather; especially for his historical and biographical
Works. Were these alone to be struck
out of Existence it would make a Void in these
Departments of our Literature, that would probably
confound any who affect to look upon them
with Contempt. Even Dr. Douglass, although
he has somewhere asserted, that, to point out all
the Errors in the <i>Magnalia</i>, would be to copy
the whole Book, is nevertheless, much indebted
to him for Facts in many Parts of the very Work
in which he has made that Statement; hence it
would be very bad Logic that would not charge
Dr. Douglass with copying Errors into his Work,
knowing them to be Errors. It would be very
easy for us to point to some Writers of our own
Time equally obnoxious to the same plain Kind
of Argument. And a late Writer of very good
Standing has, with great apparent Deliberation
said, that, "it is impossible to deny, that the Reputation
of Cotton Mather has declined of late
Years." This, of course, was his Belief; but it
strikes us as very singular, that that same Author,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">lxxi</a></span>
should, at the same Time, make the largest Book
on the Life of a Man, in such a <i>State of Decline</i>,
that had hitherto appeared! But we are under
no Concern for the Reputation of Cotton Mather,
even in the Hands of his Enemies, and we
have no Intention of setting up a special Defence
of him or his Writings. We are willing the
latter should pass for exactly what they are worth.
All we design to do is to caution those a little
who need Caution, and save them, if we may,
from having the Windows in their own Houses
broken, by the very Missiles they themselves have
thrown.</p>

<p>But so far from the <i>Reputation</i> of Dr. Mather
being in a <i>Decline</i>, his Writings have never been
so much sought after as at the present Time!
So much so that even Reprints of such of them
as have been made are at once taken up, and at
high Prices. Twenty Years ago, the <i>Magnalia</i>
did not command above eight or ten Dollars,
while Copies are at present rarely to be had for five
Times their former Price. Reference is had to
the original Edition, of course. This can hardly
be taken as an Indication of a declining Reputation.
The Style in all his Works, though
peculiar to himself, is nevertheless attractive, and
never tedious, although often upon tedious Subjects.
In Point of Scholarship, he was not
excelled by any in the Country, and would not
suffer by a Comparison with the best of his Time
in England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">lxxii</a></span>

 The Charge of excessive Credulity has been
brought against Dr. Mather, as though that
Trait of Character were peculiar to him alone.
There does not appear to be any Justice in
singling him out as responsible for all the Credulity
in the Country. That he was credulous
no One will deny, nor will it be denied that he
was surrounded by a credulous Community, the
great Majority of which were equally credulous,
and he was made to speak for them. Hence he
has become conspicuous while others are nearly
or quite forgotten. All Men are credulous in
some Way and upon certain Things. Belief and
Credulity are much the same. The Degree of
Evidence required to convert the latter into the
former has never been settled; nor can it be until
all Minds are of the same Capacity. It requires
a large Amount daily of Credulity to enable us
to live in the tolerably good Opinion of our
Companions in and out of Doors everywhere.
Dismiss all of that liberal Sentiment from our
Minds and we should be dismissed by the most of
our Friends.</p>

<p>In the Reprints of some of the Works of Dr.
Mather great Injustice has been done him,
while, at the same Time, a Cheat has been put
upon the Public. One Instance may be here
given. In the Year 1815 there appeared a tolerably
neat Edition of the <i>Christian Philosopher</i>,<a name="FNanchor_27_26" id="FNanchor_27_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_26" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
in a Duodecimo of 324 Pages, printed at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii">lxxiii</a></span>Charlestown, for which a Copyright appears to
have been taken out. On a cursory Examination
we can discover no Ground for copyrighting
this Edition, except for making it unlike the
Original in one Respect only, namely, Omission
of Important Matter. As an Example of the
Omissions the following may be taken: "We
read of Heaven <i>giving Snow like Wool</i>. I have
known it <i>give a Snow of Wool</i>. In a Town of
<i>New England</i>, called <i>Fairfield</i>, in a bitter snowy
Night, there fell a Quantity of Snow, which
covered a large frozen Pond, but of such a <i>woolen</i>
Consistence, that it can be called nothing but
<i>Wool</i>. I have a Quantity of it, that has been
these many Years lying by me."</p>

<p>Now, in the Edition of 1815, this important
Passage is entirely omitted! If Dr. Mather was
imposed upon by some ignorant and mischievous
Wight, that has nothing to do in excusing a Deception
on the Part of a Publisher, who contracts
to reprint a Work without any Reservation. If
an Editor or Publisher thinks to save the Credit
of his Author by falsifying his Text, he can only
be sure of one Thing, and that is, to bring discredit
upon himself.</p>

<p>I must here dismiss the <i>Christian Philosopher</i>;
but in another Work by our Author, of an
earlier Date,<a name="FNanchor_28_27" id="FNanchor_28_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_27" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> there is a singular Story of Snow
which may be noticed here: "It was credibly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv">lxxiv</a></span>affirmed, that in the Winter of the Year 1688,
there fell a <i>Red Snow</i>, which lay like Blood on a
Spot of Ground, not many Miles from Boston;
but the Dissolution of it by a Thaw, which
within a few Hours melted it, made it not
capable of lying under the Contemplation of so
many <i>Witnesses</i> as it might be worthy of."</p>

<p>As the <i>Red Snow</i> did not come under the
Doctor's immediate Observation, he has spoken
of it with commendable Caution; insomuch that
his Character for Credulity is not enhanced by
the Relation of the Story. Moreover it is a well
known Fact that <i>Red Snow</i> is often mentioned by
reputable northern Travelers. But we have
never heard that it <i>snowed Wool</i> at any other
Time and Place, except as mentioned above.</p>

<p>In 1692, Dr. Mather published his <i>Wonders
of the Invisible World</i>. This was the authorized
Account of the Witchcraft Cases of that Time.
In this he laid himself open to the Charge of
Credulity, which, it cannot be denied, has been
pretty well sustained ever since.</p>

<p>Many have reproached Dr. Mather, as though
he was the Author of that dismal and awful Delusion.
This is singularly unjust. He was himself
one of the deluded; and this is the only
Charge that can lie against him relative to it.
All the World then believed in Witchcraft, and
People entered into it according to their Temperament
and Circumstances. The Delusion
was not a Native of New England, but an Exotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv">lxxv</a></span>
from the Father Land; and it had been well if
this had been the only one imported thence.
Even when Prosecutions had ceased, there was
not a Cessation of a Belief in the Reality of
Witchcraft; its Progress was stayed from a very
different Cause, as is now too well known to be
entered into or explained. Even to the present
Day there are Thousands who believe in its
Reality; and that Belief can only be extirpated
by the Progress of genuine Knowledge. Within
our Remembrance we could ride from Boston in
a single Day, with a very moderate Horse, into
a New England Town where the Belief in
Witchcraft was very general, and where many an
old Horse-shoe could have been seen nailed to
half the Bedsteads in the Town to keep away
those imaginary Miscreants who came riding
through the Air upon Broomsticks, or across the
Lots upon the Back of some poor old Woman,
who perhaps from some Malady had not left her
House for Years. How much short of a Day's
Ride by Steam or otherwise it would now be
necessary to take to reach a Place where the Belief
exists, we shall not undertake, but leave for
others to determine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cotton Mather</span> was undoubtedly the most
prominent Author who wrote on Witchcraft,
and in the full Belief of it, in his Time, in
this Country; this Circumstance accounts for
his being singled out by "one <i>Robert Calef</i>,"
who attacked him with some Success, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi">lxxvi</a></span>
then, in his Book which he called <i>More
Wonders of the Invisible World</i>, &amp;c., which
he published in London, in a quarto Volume,
in the Year 1700. In his Book, Calef styles
himself "Merchant, of <i>Boston</i> in <i>New England</i>."
Now in the Absence of Proof to the
contrary, it may not be unfair to presume, that
Calef issued his Work quite as soon as he dared
to, and quite as soon as public Opinion would
tolerate a Work which had for its Aim a deadly
Blow against a Belief in the imaginary Crime of
Witchcraft. For we know that as soon as Calef's
Book did appear, some of Dr. Mather's Friends
came out with another Work against that Author,
from the Title of which alone its Contents can
pretty well be judged of. It is <i>Some few Remarks
upon a Scandalous Book written by one
Robert Calef</i>. But this Book and its Authors
are alike almost unknown, while Calef occupies
a conspicuous Place among the Benefactors of
Mankind.</p>

<p>The foreign Correspondence of Dr. Mather was
very extensive; "so that," says his Son, "I have
known him at one Time to have above <i>fifty</i> beyond
Sea." Among his Correspondents were
many of the most learned and famous Men in
Europe; as <span class="smcap">Sir Richard Blackmore</span>, <span class="smcap">Mr. Whiston</span>,
<span class="smcap">Dr. Desaguliers</span>, <span class="smcap">Mr. Pillionere</span>, <span class="smcap">Dr.
Franckius</span>, <span class="smcap">Wm. Waller</span>, <span class="smcap">Dr. Chamberlain</span>,
<span class="smcap">Dr. Woodward</span>, <span class="smcap">Dr. Jurin</span>, <span class="smcap">Dr. Watts</span>, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. In a Letter which he wrote in 1743 Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvii" id="Page_lxxvii">lxxvii</a></span>
Watts says, "he had enjoyed a happy Correspondence
with Dr. Cotton Mather, for nearly twenty
Years before his Death, as well as with the Rev.
Mr. Samuel Mather, his Son, ever since."</p>

<p>In 1710 came out a Book from the Pen of
our Author, which he entitled "<i>Bonifacius:</i> An
Essay upon the <span class="smcap">Good</span> to be devised by those who
would answer the great End of Life." In this
Work are many good Maxims and Reflections,
but its Popularity has probably been very much
enhanced by what Dr. Franklin has said of it.
Dr. Mather was well acquainted with Franklin
when the latter was a young Man; and when
Franklin was an old Man, in the Year 1784, in
writing to Samuel Mather, Son of our Subject,
he thus alludes to it in his happy Style: "When
I was a Boy, I met with a Book entitled, <i>Essays
to do Good</i>, which I think was written by your
Father. It had been so little regarded by a
former Possessor, that several Leaves of it were
torn out; but the Remainder gave me such a
Turn of thinking, as to have an Influence on my
Conduct through Life; for I have always set a
greater Value on the Character of a <i>Doer of Good</i>
than on any other Kind of Reputation." In the
same Letter is to be found that often told anecdote
of an Interview he once had with Dr. Mather.
This too, that it may lose nothing at our
Hands, we will give in the Author's own
Words: "You mention being in your seventy-eighth
Year; I am in my seventy-ninth; we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxviii" id="Page_lxxviii">lxxviii</a></span>
are grown old together. It is now more than
sixty Years since I left Boston, but I remember
well both your Father and Grandfather;
having heard them both in the Pulpit, and seen
them in their Houses. The last Time I saw
your Father was in the Beginning of 1724, when
I visited him after my first Trip to Pennsylvania.
He received me in his Library, and on my taking
leave showed me a shorter Way out of the House
through a narrow Passage, which was crossed by
a Beam overhead. We were still talking as I
withdrew, he accompanying me behind, and I
turning partly towards him, when he said hastily,
'<i>stoop, stoop!</i>' I did not understand him, till I
felt my Head hit against the Beam. He was a
Man that never missed any Occasion of giving
Instruction, and upon this he said to me, '<i>You
are young, and have the World before you</i>; <span class="smcap">Stoop</span>
<i>as you go through it, and you will miss many hard
Thumps</i>,' This Advice, thus beat into my Head,
has frequently been of Use to me; and I often
think of it, when I see Pride mortified, and
Misfortunes brought upon People by their carrying
their Heads too high." This Moral, so
essentially good in itself, does not need the high
Recommendation of a Franklin, though but for
him it would not, probably, have been brought
to the Knowledge of every Youth who has
learned, or may yet learn to read.</p>

<p>The <i>Essay to do Good</i> has passed through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxix" id="Page_lxxix">lxxix</a></span>many Editions, but how many it would be difficult
 to determine. It was several Times reprinted
in London, once as late as 1807, under
the Supervision of the distinguished Dr. George
Burder. In this Country its Issue has not been
confined to the Press of one Denomination.</p>

<p>It may be too much a Custom for us to dwell
on the Errors and Misfortunes of People while
living; and to err, on the other Hand, by making
their Characters appear too perfect after they
have passed away; especially if they have been
sufficiently conspicuous in Life to require a
written Memorial of them after their Decease.
Though Dr. Cotton Mather had Enemies while
living, his Memory has been pursued with more
Malignity since his Death, than has happened to
that of most Men; and, as we conceive, without
sufficient Reason, and which could only be warranted
by the most undoubted Proofs, that he
has purposely led us into Errors, and that he
acted falsely on the most important Occasions;
and that, finally, he was too bad a Man to make
any Acknowledgment of all this, though conscious
of it when he took his final Departure
with the Messenger of his last Summons.</p>

<p>He had vituperative Enemies in his Lifetime,
from some of whom he received abusive anonymous
Letters. These Letters he carefully filed,
and wrote upon them simply the Word "Libels,"
which was all the Notice he took of them. It
was an invariable Rule with him, that if he was
obliged to speak of the evil Ways of People to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxx" id="Page_lxxx">lxxx</a></span>
do so in Humility and Regret, and never in a
Manner that could be offensive. In his Diary
he speaks of <i>Pride</i> as a Sin, "which all are subject
unto, and more especially Ministers," and
still more especially was it "the besetting Sin of
young Ministers." Had he lived in these latter
Days that Annoyance might have been less on
Account of its Universality.</p>

<p>Mr. Mather's Time was that of long Sermons,
and we are told that he usually closed them with
the <i>fourteenth</i> Division of his Discourses. Besides
his Labors on Sundays, he sometimes
preached eleven Sermons in one Week besides.
He also constantly had Students with him whom
he instructed in various Branches of Knowledge.</p>

<p>Of the Part Dr. Mather took in State Affairs,
his Biographer says he was not at Liberty to omit
an Account, although it was a difficult Section;
and that he was "more at a Loss what to do
about it than any one in the whole Book." The
Author, however, concludes, as he could not
omit the Subject, to treat it "in such a general
Way as to give no One any Offence." And as it
is a <i>Section</i> of the Doctor's Life of great Interest,
it will here be given entire in the Language of
his Biographer, who wrote so near the Time
that his Account carries its Readers back to those
stirring Scenes of the Revolution of 1688, and
furnishes a Picture, life-like, of the every-day
Manners of our Fathers on that memorable and
novel Event.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxi" id="Page_lxxxi">lxxxi</a></span>

 The Account follows: "My Country is very
sensible that in the Year 1688 (when one of the
most wicked Kings was on the British Throne)
Andros and his Crew were very violent, illegal
and arbitrary in their Proceedings. I need not
give any Narrative of their Managements here,
because there has been an Account of them already
given to the World.<a name="FNanchor_29_28" id="FNanchor_29_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_28" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>"While these roaring Lions and ranging Bears
were in the midst of their Ravages; it was in
the Month of April when we had News by the
Edges concerning a Descent made upon England
by the Prince of Orange for the Rescue of the
Nations from Slavery and Popery; then a strange
Disposition entred into the Body of our People to
assert our Liberties against the arbitrary Rulers
that were fleecing them. But it was much
feared by the more sensible Gentlemen at Boston,
that an unruly Company of Soldiers, who had
newly deserted the Service in which they had
bin employed for the Eastern War, by the gathering
of their Friends to them to protect them
from the Governor, who, they tho't, intended
Nothing but Ruine to them, would make a great
Stir, and produce a bloody Revolution. And
therefore the principal Gentlemen in Boston met
with Mr. Mather to consult what was best to be
done; and they all agreed, if possible, that they
would extinguish all Essays in our People to an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxii" id="Page_lxxxii">lxxxii</a></span>Insurrection; but that, if the country People to
the Northward, by any violent Motions push'd on
the Matter so far as to make a Revolution unavoidable,
then to prevent the shedding of Blood
by an ungoverned Multitude, some of the Gentlemen
present would appear in the Head of
what Action should be done; and a Declaration
was prepared accordingly.</p>

<p>"On April 18, the People were so driving and
furious, that unheaded they began to seize our
public Oppressors: upon which the Gentlemen
aforesaid found it necessary to appear that by
their Authority among the People the unhappy
Tumults might be a little regulated.
And thro' the Goodness of God, although the
whole Country were now in a most prodigious
Ferment and Thousands of exasperated People
in Arms were come into Boston, yet there was
no Manner of Outrage committed; only the
<i>Public Robbers</i> that had lorded it over Us were
confined. 'Twas then Mr. Mather appeared&mdash;He
was the Instrument of preventing the Excesses
into which the <i>Wrath of Man</i> is too ready
to run. He came, and like a Nestor or Ulisses
reasoned down the Passions of the Populace.
Had he lisped a Syllable for it, perhaps the People
would, by a sudden Council of War, have
try'd, judg'd and hang'd those ill Men who
would have treated him otherwise. Nevertheless
he set himself both publicly and privately to
hinder the Peoples proceeding any further than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxiii" id="Page_lxxxiii">lxxxiii</a></span>
to reserve the Criminals for the Justice of the
English Parliament.</p>

<p>"Now the Persecution which was intended for
Mr. Mather was diverted; for on that very Day
that he was to be committed to <i>Half a Year's
Imprisonment</i>,<a name="FNanchor_30_29" id="FNanchor_30_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_29" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> those that would have wrong'd
him were justly taken into Custody: And yet so
generous was he as not only to expose his Name,
but even his Life unto the Rage of the Multitude
for the saving of some that would have hurt him:
Tho' he had no Thanks for his Ingenuity.</p>

<p>"The Spirit which acted him in these Matters
is expressed in a Sermon he preached to the Convention
of the Colony from 2 Chron. xv, 2. It
was printed under the Title of, <i>The Way to
Prosperity</i>.</p>

<p>"A few Days before this, the Inhabitants of
Boston assembling together to chuse Representatives
for that Convention, it was apprehended,
that the different Persuasions of the People, about
the next Steps to be taken for our Settlement,
would have produced a Fury near to Bloodshed;
and therefore Mr. Mather was desired to be at
their Meeting. The Meeting began with dangerous
and horrible Paroxysms, which when he
saw, he upon it made an affectionate and moving
Speech to them, at which many fell into Tears
and the whole Body of the People present immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxiv" id="Page_lxxxiv">lxxxiv</a></span>
united in the Methods of Peace Mr.
Mather proposed unto them."</p>

<p>From what is here given it is not difficult
to decide whether Mr. Mather was for or against
Andros and his Government. It is a Pity the
Author did not revise his Work in his mature
Years, as well for his own Credit as a Writer as
for his Father's Honor. It is the poorest of all
his Performances.</p>

<p>The Convention before mentioned having
ordered a Thanksgiving, for that "It having
pleased the God of Heaven to mitigate his many
Frowns upon us in the Summer past, with a
Mixture of some very signal Favours, and in the
midst of Wrath so far to remember Mercy;
That our Indian Enemies have had a Check put
upon their Designs of Blood and Spoil, ...
and especially in the happy Accession of Their
Majesties our Sovereigns, King William and
Queen Mary to the Throne. It was therefore
ordered that Thursday the 19th of December,
1689, be kept as a Day of Thanksgiving." This
Order was dated Dec. 3d, 1689.</p>

<p>On this Thanksgiving Occasion Dr. Mather
delivered one of his most elaborate Sermons,
occupying, with a brief Appendix, <i>sixty-two
Pages</i>, 16mo. In it he refers to the Revolution
under various Heads; comparing it to an Earthquake,
one having then but recently nearly
destroyed Lima. And more terrible Pictures it
would be difficult to conceive of, than he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxv" id="Page_lxxxv">lxxxv</a></span>
drawn, of what would have been the Condition
of New England, had not the Revolution succeeded.</p>

<p>The next great Event in the Life of our
Author was the Witchcraft Delusion. As his
own Work upon that memorable Chapter in
New England's Annals is to be given in Connection
with this Biography, any Apology or Remarks
upon his Participation in it from the
Editor could be of but little Value or Interest,
no more will be done here than to extract what
his Biographer-Son has favored the World with.
That, as will be seen, is apologetical, and is far
better told than the Part he took in the Revolution.
It is indeed about all that can be said in
Extenuation of one thus circumstanced.</p>

<p>"The Summer of the Year 1692, was a very
doleful Time unto the whole Country. The
Devils, after a most præternatural Manner by the
dreadful Judgements of Heaven took a bodily
Possession of many People in our Salem, and
Places adjacent; where the Houses of the poor
People began to be filled with the Cries of Persons
tormented by evil Spirits. There seemed to
be an execrable Witchcraft in the Foundation of
this wondrous Affliction; many Persons of divers
Characters being accused, apprehended, prosecuted
upon the <i>Visions</i> of the afflicted.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mather, for his Part, was always afraid
of proceeding to convict and condemn any Person
as a <i>Confederate</i> with afflicting Dæmons upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxvi" id="Page_lxxxvi">lxxxvi</a></span>
so feeble an Evidence as a <i>spectral Representation</i>.
Accordingly he ever testified against it both
publicly and privately, and particularly in his
Letter to the Judges, he besought them that they
would by no Means admit it; and where a considerable
Assembly of Ministers gave in their
Advice about the Matter, he not only concurred
with the Advice but he drew it up.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, on the other Side, he saw in most
of the Judges a charming Instance of Prudence
and Patience; and as he knew their exemplary
Piety, so he observed the Agony of Soul with
which they sought the Direction of Heaven,
above most other of our People who were enchanted
into a raging, railing and unreasonable
Disposition. For this Cause, tho' Mr. Mather
could not allow the Principles some of the Judges
had espoused, he could not however but speak
honorably of their Persons on all Occasions; and
his Compassion upon the Sight of their Difficulties,
which Compassion was raised by his Journeys
to Salem the chief Seat of these diabolical Vexations,
caused him still to go to the Place. And
merely for this Reason, some mad People in the
Country (from whom one or two credulous
Foreigners have dared to publish the abusive
Story) under a Fascination of their <i>Spirits</i> equal
to what our <i>Energumens</i> had upon their <i>Bodies</i>,
reviled Mr. Mather as if he had been the Doer
of the hard Things that were done in the Prosecution
of the Witchcraft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxvii" id="Page_lxxxvii">lxxxvii</a></span>

 "In this evil Time Mr. Mather offered at the
Beginning, that if the <i>possessed People</i> might be
scattered far asunder, he would singly provide for
six of them; and he with some others would see
whether without more bitter Methods, <i>Prayer</i>
and <i>Fasting</i> would not put an End unto these
heavy Trials: But his offer was not accepted.</p>

<p>"However for a great Part of the Summer he
did almost every Week spend a Day by himself
in the Exercise of a secret Fast before the Lord.
On these Days he cried unto God, not only for
his own Preservation from the Malice and Power
of the evil Angels, but also for a good Issue of the
Calamities in which he had permitted the evil
Angels to ensnare the miserable Country. He
also besought the Lord that he would enable him,
prosper, direct, and accept him in publishing such
Testimonies for Him as were proper, and would
be serviceable unto his Interests on that Occasion.</p>

<p>"And that a right Use might be made of the
prodigious Things which had been happening
among us, he now composed and published his
Book entituled, <i>The Wonders of the Invisible
World</i>, which was reprinted several Times in
London: In the Preface he speaks of, '<i>the heart-breaking
Exercises</i>', he went thro' in writing it.
There was a certain Disbeliever of Witchcraft
who wrote against this Book; but as the Man is
dead, his Book died long before him.<a name="FNanchor_31_30" id="FNanchor_31_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_30" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxviii" id="Page_lxxxviii">lxxxviii</a></span></p>
<p>"But having spoken eno' of the more publick
Witchcraft, I think I will hale in here an Account
of a Witchcraft happening in one private
Family at Boston, two or three Years before the
general one. 'Twas, I think, in the Year 1689,
in the Winter, that several Children belonging to
a pious Family at the South End of Boston were
horribly bewitch'd and possessed.<a name="FNanchor_32_31" id="FNanchor_32_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_31" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>"Mr. Mather tho't it would be for the Glory
of God, if he not only pray'd with as well as for
the Children; but also took an Account of the
extraordinary Symptoms which attended them,
with sufficient Attestations to confound the Sadducism
and Atheism of a debauched Age."</p>

<p>An <span class="err" title="original: Accouut">Account</span> of the Case of the Goodwin
Family was separately published, and was noticed
with Commendation by the "learned and pious
Baxter," which has been often referred to as a
Proof that other great Men, as well as Mr.
Mather, were Believers in Witchcraft.</p>

<p>The Novelty and Singularity of a Thing was
no Cause of its Rejection by Mr. Mather, and we
next find him advocating Inoculation for the
Small-pox; and, according to his Biographer he
was the Cause of its Introduction into this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxix" id="Page_lxxxix">lxxxix</a></span>Country. But in that, as in many other Things,
too much is claimed for him. I have elsewhere
given a History of its being put in Practice in
Boston.<a name="FNanchor_33_32" id="FNanchor_33_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_32" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>In 1714 Dr. Mather was chosen a Member of
the Royal Society of London; upon which Event
his Biographer remarks: "The Respect which
the Royal Society paid him, did also very much
encourage him, and fortify him in his Essays to
do Good, while it added to the superior Circumstances
in which he was placed above the Contempt
of Envious Men."</p>

<p>This last remark will apply to some of our own
Times; who, if their Power were equal to their
Envy, few besides themselves would be allowed
to possess much in the Way of Honors without
their Permission. It was probably on this Occasion,
that some Individuals circulated the Report
that the Doctor was not a Member of the Royal
Society. Whereupon a Letter from the Secretary
of that Society was produced, in which this Passage
occurs: "As for your being chosen a Member
of the Royal Society, that has been done, both
by the Council and Body of the Society: only the
Ceremony of Admission is wanting; which you
being beyond Sea, cannot be performed." This
having been promulgated, the envious Detractors
were silenced in that Age, and it is rather surprising
that Ignorance and Malice should attempt
to revive it in this. As Mr. Mather never visited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xc" id="Page_xc">xc</a></span>England, he of course never attended a Meeting
of the Royal Society. But this did not affect his
Membership. That this did not affect his Membership
may be mentioned as pretty good Evidence,
the Fact that some of his Works were soon
after published in London, in the best Style of
the Day, having appended to his Name in their
Title-Pages, "D. D. and Fellow of the Royal
Society." Now such an Assumption would have
been an Offence of a serious Character, had it
been merely an Assumption; and a Rebuke would
have gone forth from the Royal Society, and
would ever since have been a Matter of Record and
Notoriety. But Nothing of the Kind is heard of,
plainly because Dr. Mather stood right with the
Records of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>Nobody will charge the <span class="smcap">Rev. Thomas Prince</span>
with Insincerity in what he has said of his Colaborers,
and <small>HE</small> says, "Dr. Cotton Mather, though
born and constantly residing in this remote corner
of America, has yet for near these forty Years
made so rising and great a Figure in the learned
World, as has attracted to him while alive, the
Eyes of many at the furthest Distance; and now
deceased, can't but raise a very general Wish to
see the Series, and more especially the domestic
Part of so distinguished a Life exhibited. His
printed Writings so full of Piety and various
Erudition, his vast Correspondence, and the continual
Reports of Travellers who had conversed
with him, had spread his Reputation into other
Countries. And when, about fourteen Years ago, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xci" id="Page_xci">xci</a></span>
travelled abroad, I could not but admire to what
Extent his Fame had reached, and how inquisitive
were Gentlemen of Letters to hear and know of
the most particular and lively Manner, both of his
private Conversation and public Performances
among us."</p>

<p>Dr. Colman speaks in the highest Terms of
Dr. Mather, in his Funeral Sermon. "His printed
Works," he says, "will not convey to Posterity,
nor give to Strangers a just Idea of the real Worth
and great Learning of the Man." To this and a
great deal more equally commendatory, Mr.
Prince subscribes in these Words: "Every one
who intimately knew the Doctor will readily
assent to this Description."</p>

<p>It would be difficult, perhaps, to produce an
Example of Industry equal to that of which we
are speaking. In one Year, it is said he kept sixty
Fasts and twenty vigils, and published fourteen
Books&mdash;all this besides performing his ministerial
Duties; which, in those Days, were Something
more than <i>nominal</i>. He kept a Diary, which has
been extensively used by some of his Biographers,
but we have not sought after it, as it is said to be
scattered in different Places! How this happened
we have not been informed. Notwithstanding
he published so many Works, he left nearly as
much unpublished in Manuscript; the principal
Part of which is entitled, <i>Biblia Americana</i>, or
<i>The Sacred Scriptures of the Old and New Testament
Illustrated</i>. For the Publication of this Work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcii" id="Page_xcii">xcii</a></span>
Proposals were issued soon after its Author died,
but Nothing further seems to have been done
about it. Of the <i>Biblia Americana</i>, the Doctor's
Son remarks, "<i>That</i> is a Work, the writing of
which is enough constantly to employ a Man,
unless he be a Miracle of Diligence, the Half of
the three Score Years and ten, the Sum of Years
allowed to us."</p>

<p>It remains now to mention the Book by which
Dr. Mather is best known, and which will make his
Name prominent through all coming Time&mdash;the
Reader's Mind is already in Advance of the Pen&mdash;the
<i>MAGNALIA CHRISTI AMERICANA</i>.
This was printed in London, in 1702, in a moderate
sized folio Volume, the Aggregate of its
Pages being 794. It is chiefly a Collection of what
the Author had before printed on historical and
biographical Subjects. The Value of its Contents
has been variously estimated. Some decrying it
below <i>any</i> Value, while others pronounce it "the
only Classic ever written in America." At the
Hazard of incurring the Charge of Stupidity, we
are of the decided Opinion that it has a Value
between those Extremes. But we have sufficiently
expressed our Mind on the Value of the Author's
Works before.</p>

<p>Until about the Year 1853 there had been
but two Editions of the <i>Magnalia</i>. The Work
was then stereotyped and issued in two handsome
octavo Volumes, by the late Mr. Silas Andrus,
extensively known among the Publishers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xciii" id="Page_xciii">xciii</a></span>
Country. This was the third Edition of the
Work, and possessed the Advantage of Translations
of the Quotations from the dead Languages with
which the Work abounds. About two Years
later an Edition was issued from the same stereotype
Plates, and was accompanied by an Index.
This, tho' very incomplete, rendered the Work
much more valuable. The Plates we are informed
are now in the Hands of Mr. William Gowans
of New York, who is preparing to bring out a
sumptuous Edition of it with a new and complete
Index. About thirty-two Years had elapsed between
the second and third Editions, though they
were by the same Publisher. The Date of the
second was 1820.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this Edition was printed from a
Copy of that in Folio, which had not the Errata, and
consequently abounds with all the Errors contained
in the original Edition. To those who do not
understand the Matter, this printing an Edition of
the <i>Magnalia</i> without correcting its Errata, may
seem to incur for the Publisher severe Reprehension.
But the Truth appears to be, that the Copy
used in printing the new Edition had not the complete
Errata attached to it; and that in Fact, but
very few Copies of the original Edition can be
found to which it is attached. Now we account
for its Rarity in this Way. Dr. Mather, living in
Boston while his Work was printing in London,
could make no Corrections while it was passing
through the Press; but when he received his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xciv" id="Page_xciv">xciv</a></span>
Copies afterwards, he found so many Errors that
he was induced to print an extra Sheet of Corrections.
This extra Sheet may not have been struck
off until most of the Copies of the <i>Magnalia</i> which
had been sent to New England were distributed.
Thus we account for the rare Occurrence
of Copies of the <i>Magnalia</i> containing the Errata;
and hence we think the Publisher of the Edition of
1820 should not be too severely censured. That
our Solution is correct, we would mention that out
of a great many Copies of the folio Edition imported
by ourself and others from England, not
one of them contained the Errata in Question.</p>

<p>On the last Page of the <i>Magnalia</i>, the following
are the last three Lines: "<span class="smcap">Errata</span>. Reader, Carthagenia
was of the Mind, that unto those <i>three
Things</i> which the Ancients held impossible, there
should be added this <i>fourth</i>, to find a Book printed
without <i>Erratas</i>. It seems the Hands of <i>Briareus</i>,
and the Eyes of <i>Argus</i> will not prevent them."
And the additional Errata of which we have been
speaking, the Author thus prefaces: "The <i>Holy
Bible</i> it self, in some of its Editions, hath been affronted
with scandalous Errors of the <i>Press-work</i>;
and in one of them, they so printed those Words,
Psalms cxix, 161, '<i>Printers have persecuted me</i>,'"
&amp;c.</p>

<p>When the <i>Magnalia</i> was published, Dr. Mather's
old Schoolmaster, among others, wrote commendatory
Poetry upon it, which was, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcv" id="Page_xcv">xcv</a></span>
Fashion of the Day, inserted in its introductory
Pages. The following brief Specimen by <span class="smcap">Tompson</span>
may not be thought inappropriate to be
extracted here:</p>
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Is the bless'd <span class="smcap">Mather</span> Necromancer turn'd,</div>
<div class="i0">To raise his Country's Father's Ashes urn'd?</div>
<div class="i0">Elisha's Dust, Life to the Dead imparts;</div>
<div class="i0">This Prophet by his more familiar Arts,</div>
<div class="i0">Unseals our Hero's Tombs, and gives them Air;</div>
<div class="i0">They rise, they walk, they talk, look wondrous fair;</div>
<div class="i0">Each of them in an Orb of Light doth shine,</div>
<div class="i0">In Liveries of Glory most divine.</div>
<div class="i2">When ancient Names I in thy Pages meet,</div>
<div class="i0">Like Gems on Aaron's costly Breast-plate set;</div>
<div class="i0">Methinks Heaven's open, while great Saints descend,</div>
<div class="i0">To wreathe the Brows, by which their Acts were penned."</div>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Few Ministers preached a greater Number of
Funeral Sermons than Dr. Mather; and when he
died his Cotemporaries seemed to have vied with
each other in performing the same Office for him.
Several of their Sermons were printed. Some of
these with their quaint Titles are now before us.
Foremost among them appears that of the excellent
<span class="smcap">Mr. Prince</span>; he entitled his, "The Departure
of <span class="smcap">Elijah</span> lamented.&mdash;A Sermon occasioned
by the great and publick Loss in the <i>Decease</i> of
the very <span class="smcap">Reverend</span> and <span class="smcap">Learned</span> COTTON
MATHER, D.D., F.R.S., and Senior Pastor of
the <i>North Church</i> in Boston. Who left this Life
on <i>Feb. 13th, 1727,8</i>. The Morning after he
finished the LXV. Year of his Age." From
2 Kings ii, 12, 13. The Imprint of this Sermon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcvi" id="Page_xcvi">xcvi</a></span>
is, "<span class="smcap">Boston</span> in <i>New England:</i> Printed for <i>D.
Henchman</i>, near the Brick Meeting House in
Cornhill. MDCCXXVIII."</p>

<p>The running Title of Dr. Colman's Sermon on
the same Occasion is "The holy Walk and
glorious Translation of blessed <i>ENOCH</i>." His
Text was Gen. v. 24. It would be difficult to
find anything of the Kind, either before or since,
which, in our Judgment, is superior to this Discourse
of Dr. Colman; but valuable as it is, we
cannot introduce Extracts from it here. His
Allusion, however, to the then past and present
State of Things connected with his Subject, is so
happy that we cannot overlook it.</p>

<p>"Dr. Mather's Brethren in the Ministry here,"
he says, "are bereaved and weak with him. God
has taken their Father as well as his, from their
Heads this Day. He was a Pastor in the Town
when the eldest of the present Pastors were but
Children, and long before most of them were
born. They are weak indeed when he that is
now speaking to them is the <i>first</i> in Years among
them, in all respects else the least," &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Rev. Joshua Gee</span>, Colleague with Dr.
Mather, also preached a Funeral Sermon on his
departed Friend, entitled, "<span class="smcap">Israel's</span> <i>Mourning</i> for
<span class="smcap">Aaron's</span> <i>Death</i>." In this Discourse there is the
following important Note: "Within a few Months
past, we have been called to lament the Deaths of
two such aged Servants of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>. The Rev.
<i>Mr. Samuel Danforth</i> of Taunton, who died Nov.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcvii" id="Page_xcvii">xcvii</a></span>
14. And my honored Father-in-law, the Rev.
<i>Mr. Peter Thatcher</i> of Milton, who died Dec.
17, 1727: while the Days of mourning were
scarce over in this Town for my dearly beloved
Friend and Brother, the Rev. <i>Mr. William Waldron</i>,
who died Sept. 11, 1727."</p>

<p>Dr. Mather's Son and Biographer, "<span class="smcap">Samuel
Mather</span>, M. A., and Chaplain at <span class="smcap">Castle William</span>,"
also preached a Funeral Sermon on his
Father's Death. "The <i>Departure</i> and <i>Character</i>
of <span class="smcap">Elijah</span> considered and improved," was its
running Title. Only about five Years before, the
deceased preached a Sermon on the Death of his
Father; in the Title-page of which, when printed,
instead of the Author's Name we read, "By one
who, as a <span class="smcap">Son</span> with a <i>FATHER</i>, served with him
in the Gospel."</p>

<p>Dr. Mather died intestate, and the Order of
the Judge of Probate for the Distribution of his
Estate is as follows: "One third to his Widow,
Lydia Mather; two single Shares or fourth Parts
to Samuel Mather, Clerk, only surviving Son, and
one Share each to the Rest of his Children, viz.,
Abigail Willard, deceased, Wife of Daniel Willard,
also deceased, their Children and legal Representatives,
and Hannah Mather, Spinster."
Dated, 25th May, 1730.</p>

<p>The Portrait now in Circulation of Dr. Mather
was engraved from a beautiful <i>Mezzotinto</i>, half
Size, with the following Inscription underneath
it:</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcviii" id="Page_xcviii">xcviii</a></span>

"Cottonus Matherus S. Theologiæ Doctor
Regiæ Societatis Londiniensis Socius, et Eccelsiæ
apud Bostonum Nov˭Anglorum nuper Præpositus.</p>

<p>Ætatis Suæ LXV. MDCCXXVII.</p>

<p class="center">P. Pelham ad vivum pinxit ab Origin Fecit."</p></blockquote>

Mather Family, I must refer to the Pedigree

<p><a name="Footnote_34_33" id="Footnote_34_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_33"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> Edmund Bohun was himself a
Writer of considerable Note. The
Work by which he is best known
is probably that entitled <i>The Character
of Queen Elizabeth</i>, a sizable
Octavo, printed in 1693. His Writings
are said to be Voluminous, yet
but few of them are met with at this
Day. One of the first Gazetteers
was by him in a thick Octavo, 1688.
He does not, however, call it a
Gazetteer, but a Geographical Dictionary.
His Descriptions compare
singularly with those of the same
Articles in Works of later Times:
as for Example, he says Columbus
discovered America in 1499. All
the Notice Boston receives at his
Hands is at the Close of an Article
on Boston in Lincolnshire&mdash;"there
is another Place in <i>New England</i>
of the same Name." Under the
Head of New England he gives it a
much larger Notice; calls New
England <i>a Colony</i>, "and they have
built seven great Towns, the Chief
of which is Boston, which in 1670,
had fifty Sail of Ships belonging to
it." He was Author of a Life of Bishop
Jewell, and was living in 1700.</p></div></div>

who reports, that One of his
Acquaintance, devoutly making his
Prayers on the behalf of a Person
molested by <i>Evil Spirits</i>, received
from those <i>Evil Spirits</i> an horrible Blow over the
Face: And I may my self expect not few or small
Buffetings from Evil Spirits, for the Endeavours
wherewith I am now going to encounter them.
I am far from Insensible that at this extraordinary
Time of the <i>Devils coming down in great Wrath
upon us</i>, there are too many Tongues and Hearts
thereby <i>set on fire of Hell;</i> that the various Opinions
about the Witchcrafts which of later Time
have troubled us, are maintained by some with so
much cloudy Fury, as if they could never be sufficiently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>

stated, unless written in the Liquor
wherewith Witches use to write their Covenants;
and that he who becomes an Author at such a
time, had need be <i>fenced with Iron, and the Staff
of a Spear</i>. The unaccountable Frowardness,
Asperity, Untreatableness, and Inconsistency of
many Persons, every Day gives a visible Exposition
of that passage, <i>An evil spirit from the Lord
came upon Saul;</i> and Illustration of that Story,
<i>There met him two possessed with Devils, exceeding
fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.</i> To
send abroad a Book, among such Readers, were a
very unadvised thing, if a Man had not such
Reasons to give, as I can bring, for such an Undertaking.
Briefly, I hope it cannot be said, <i>They are
all so;</i> No, I hope the Body of this People,
are yet in such a Temper, as to be capable of
applying their Thoughts, to make a <i>Right Use</i> of
the stupendous and prodigious Things that are
happening among us: And because I was concern'd,
when I saw that no abler Hand emitted
any Essays to engage the Minds of this People, in
such holy, pious, fruitful Improvements, as God
would have to be made of his amazing Dispensations
now upon us. THEREFORE it is, that
One of the Least among the Children of <i>New-England</i>,
has here done, what is done. None, but
<i>the Father, who sees in secret</i>, knows the Heart-breaking
Exercises, wherewith I have composed
what is now [vi] going to be exposed, lest I
should in any one thing miss of doing my designed
Service for his Glory, and for his People; but I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>

am now somewhat comfortably assured of his
favourable acceptance; and, <i>I will not fear; what
can a Satan do unto me!</i><a name="FNanchor_36_35" id="FNanchor_36_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_35" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Having performed something of what God
required, in labouring to suit his Words unto his
Works, at this Day among us, and therewithal
handled a Theme that has been sometimes
counted not unworthy the Pen, even of a King,<a name="FNanchor_37_36" id="FNanchor_37_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_36" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
it will easily be perceived, that some subordinate
Ends have been considered in these Endeavours.</p>

<p>I have indeed set myself to countermine the
whole <span class="smcap">PLOT</span> of the Devil, against <i>New-England</i>,
in every Branch of it, as far as one of my <i>darkness</i>,
can comprehend such a <i>Work of Darkness</i>. I
may add, that I have herein also aimed at the
Information and Satisfaction of Good Men in
another Country, a thousand Leagues off, where
I have, it may be, more, or however, more considerable
Friends, than in <i>My Own;</i> And I do
what I can to have that Country, now, as well as
always, in the best Terms with <i>My Own</i>. But
while I am doing these things, I have been driven
a little to do something likewise for myself; I
mean, by taking off the false Reports, and hard
Censures about my Opinion in these Matters, the
<i>Parters Portion</i> which my <i>pursuit of Peace</i> has
procured me among the <i>Keen</i>. My hitherto <i>unvaried
Thoughts</i> are here published; and I believe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>

they will be owned by most of the Ministers of
God in these Colonies; nor can amends be well

T was as long ago, as the Year
1637, that a Faithful Minister
of the Church of <i>England</i>, whose
Name was Mr. <i>Edward Symons</i>,<a name="FNanchor_44_43" id="FNanchor_44_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_43" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
did in a Sermon afterwards
Printed, thus express himself; 'At <i>New-England</i>
now the Sun of Comfort begins to appear, and
the glorious Day-Star to show it self;&mdash;<i>Sed
Venient Annis Sæculæ Seris</i>, there will come
Times in after Ages, when the <i>Clouds will overshadow
and darken the Sky there</i>. Many now
promise to themselves nothing but successive
Happiness there, which for a time through God's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>

Mercy they may enjoy; and I pray God, they
may a long time; but in this World there is no
Happiness perpetual.' An <i>Observation</i>, or I had
almost said, an <i>Inspiration</i>, very dismally now
verify'd upon us! It has been affirm'd by some
who best knew <i>New-England</i>, That the World
will do <i>New-England</i> a great piece of Injustice,
if it acknowledge not a measure of Religion,
Loyalty, Honesty, and Industry, in the People
there, beyond what is to be found with any other
People for the Number of them.<a name="FNanchor_45_44" id="FNanchor_45_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_44" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> When I did
a few years ago, publish a Book, which mentioned
a few memorable Witchcrafts, committed in this
country; the excellent <i>Baxter</i>, graced the Second
Edition of that Book, with a kind Preface,
wherein he sees cause to say, <i>If any are Scandalized,
that</i> New-England, <i>a place of as serious
Piety, as any I can hear of, under Heaven, should
be troubled so much with Witches; I think, 'tis no
wonder: Where will the Devil show most Malice,
but where he is hated, and hateth most:</i> And I hope,
the Country will still deserve and answer the
Charity so expressed by that Reverend Man of
God.<a name="FNanchor_46_45" id="FNanchor_46_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_45" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Whosoever travels over this Wilderness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>

will see it richly bespangled with Evangelical
Churches, whose Pastors are holy, able, and painful
Overseers of their Flocks, lively Preachers,
and vertuous Livers; and such as in their several
Neighbourly Associations, have had their Meetings
whereat Ecclesiastical Matters of common
Concernment are considered: <i>Churches</i>, whose
Communicants have been seriously examined
about their Experiences of Regeneration, as well
as about their Knowledge, and Belief, and blameless
Conversation, before their Admission to the
Sacred Communion; although others of less but
hopeful Attainments in Christianity are not ordinarily
deny'd Baptism for themselves and theirs;
Churches, which are shye of using any thing in
the Worship of God, for which they cannot see a
Warrant of God; but with whom yet the Names
of <i>Congregational</i>, <i>Presbyterian</i>, <i>Episcopalian</i>, or
<i>Antipædobaptist</i>, are swallowed up in that of
<i>Christian;</i> Persons of all those Perswasions being
taken into our [6] Fellowship, when visible
Goodliness has recommended them:<a name="FNanchor_47_46" id="FNanchor_47_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_46" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Churches,
which usually do within themselves manage their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>own Discipline, under the Conduct of their Elders;
but yet call in the help of <i>Synods</i> upon
Emergencies, or Aggrievances; <i>Churches</i>, Lastly,
wherein Multitudes are growing ripe for Heaven
every day; and as fast as these are taken off, others
are daily rising up. And by the Presence and
Power of the Divine Institutions thus maintained
in the Country. We are still so happy, that I
suppose there is no Land in the Universe more
free from the debauching, and the debasing Vices
of Ungodliness. The Body of the People are
hitherto so disposed, that <i>Swearing</i>, <i>Sabbath-breaking</i>,
<i>Whoring</i>, <i>Drunkenness</i>, and the like, do
not make a Gentleman, but a Monster, or a Goblin,
in the vulgar Estimation.<a name="FNanchor_48_47" id="FNanchor_48_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_47" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> All this notwithstanding,
we must humbly confess to our God,
that we are miserably degenerated from the first
Love of our Predecessors; however we boast our
selves a little, when Men would go to trample
upon us, and we venture to say, <i>Wherein soever
any is bold (we speak foolishly) we are bold also</i>.<a name="FNanchor_49_48" id="FNanchor_49_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_48" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>The first Planters of these Colonies were a chosen
Generation of Men, who were first so pure, as to
disrelish many things which they thought wanted
Reformation elsewhere; and yet withal so peaceable,
that they embraced a voluntary Exile in a
squalid, horrid, <i>American</i> Desart,<a name="FNanchor_50_49" id="FNanchor_50_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_49" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> rather than to
live in Contentions with their Brethren. Those
good Men imagined that they should leave their
Posterity in a place, where they should never see
the Inroads of Profanity, or Superstition: And a
famous Person returning hence, could in a Sermon
before the Parliament profess, <i>I have been seven
Years in a Country, where I never saw one Man
drunk, or heard one Oath sworn, or beheld one
Beggar in the Streets all the while</i>.<a name="FNanchor_51_50" id="FNanchor_51_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_50" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Such great
Persons as <i>Budæus</i>, and others, who mistook Sir
<i>Thomas Moor's</i> <span class="smcap">Utopia</span>, for a Country really
existent, and stirr'd up some Divines charitably to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>undertake a Voyage thither, might now have
certainly found a Truth in their Mistake; <i>New-England</i>
was a true <i>Utopia</i>. But, alas, the
Children and Servants of those old Planters must
needs afford many degenerate Plants, and there is
now risen up a Number of People, otherwise
inclined than our <i>Joshua's</i>, and the Elders that
out-liv'd them. Those two things our holy Progenitors,
and our happy Advantages make Omissions
of Duty, and such Spiritual Disorders as the
whole World abroad is overwhelmed with, to be
as provoking in us, as the most flagitious Wickednesses
committed in other places; and the Ministers
of God are accordingly severe in their
Testimonies: But in short, those Interests of the
Gospel, which were the Errand of our Fathers
into these Ends of the Earth, have been too much
neglected and postponed, and the Attainments of
an handsome Education, have been too much
undervalued, by Multitudes that have not fallen
into Exorbitances of Wickedness; and some, especially
of our young Ones, when they have got
abroad from under the Restraints here laid upon
them, have become extravagantly and abominably
Vicious. Hence 'tis, that the Happiness of <i>New-England</i>
has been but for a time, as it was foretold,
and not for a long time, as has been desir'd
for us. A Variety of Calamity has long follow'd
this Plantation; and we have all the Reason
imaginable to ascribe it unto the Rebuke of
Heaven upon us for our manifold <i>Apostasies;</i> we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
make no right use of our Disasters: If we do not,
<i>Remember whence we are fallen, and repent, and do
the first Works</i>. But yet our Afflictions may come
under a further Consideration with us: There is
a further Cause of our Afflictions, whose due must
be given him.</p>

<p class="p2">[7] § II. The <i>New-Englanders</i> are a People of
God settled in those, which were once the <i>Devil's</i>
Territories; and it may easily be supposed that the
<i>Devil</i> was exceedingly disturbed, when he perceived
such a People here accomplishing the
Promise of old made unto our Blessed Jesus,
<i>That He should have the Utmost parts of the Earth
for his Possession</i>.<a name="FNanchor_52_51" id="FNanchor_52_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_51" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> There was not a greater Uproar
among the <i>Ephesians</i>, when the Gospel was
first brought among them, than there was among,
<i>The Powers of the Air</i> (after whom those <i>Ephesians</i>
walked) when first the <i>Silver Trumpets</i> of the
Gospel here made the <i>Joyful Sound</i>. The Devil
thus Irritated, immediately try'd all sorts of
Methods to overturn this poor Plantation: and so
much of the Church, as was <i>Fled into this Wilderness</i>,
immediately found, <i>The Serpent cast out of
his Mouth a Flood for the carrying of it away.</i> I
believe, that never were more <i>Satanical Devices</i>
used for the Unsetling of any People under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>

Sun, than what have been Employ'd for the Extirpation
of the <i>Vine</i> which God has here <i>Planted,
Casting out the Heathen, and preparing a Room
before it, and causing it to take deep Root, and fill
the Land, so that it sent its Boughs unto the</i> Atlantic
<i>Sea</i> Eastward, <i>and its Branches unto the</i> Connecticut
<i>River</i> Westward, <i>and the Hills were covered
with the shadow thereof</i>. But, All those Attempts
of Hell, have hitherto been Abortive, many an
<i>Ebenezer</i> has been Erected unto the Praise of
God, by his Poor People here; and, <i>Having obtained
Help from God, we continue to this Day</i>.
Wherefore the Devil is now making one Attempt
more upon us; an Attempt more Difficult, more
Surprizing, more snarl'd with unintelligible Circumstances
than any that we have hitherto Encountred;<a name="FNanchor_53_52" id="FNanchor_53_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_52" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
an Attempt so <i>Critical</i>, that if we
get well through, we shall soon Enjoy <i>Halcyon</i>
Days with all the <i>Vultures</i> of Hell <i>Trodden under
our Feet</i>. He has wanted his <i>Incarnate Legions</i>
to Persecute us, as the People of God have in
the other Hemisphere been Persecuted: he has
therefore drawn forth his more <i>Spiritual</i> ones to
make an Attacque upon us. We have been
advised by some Credible Christians yet alive,
that a Malefactor, accused of <i>Witchcraft</i> as well
as <i>Murder</i>, and Executed in this place more than
Forty Years ago, did then give Notice of, <i>An
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>Horrible</i> <span class="smcap">Plot</span> <i>against the Country</i> by <span class="smcap">Witchcraft</span>,
<i>and a Foundation of</i> <span class="smcap">Witchcraft</span> <i>then
laid, which if it were not seasonably discovered,
would prbably Blow up, and pull down all the
Churches in the Country</i>.<a name="FNanchor_54_53" id="FNanchor_54_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_53" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> And we have now
with Horror seen the <i>Discovery</i> of such a <i>Witchcraft!</i>
An Army of <i>Devils</i> is horribly broke in
upon the place which is the <i>Center</i>, and after a
sort, the <i>First-born</i> of our <i>English</i> Settlements:
and the Houses of the Good People there are
fill'd with the doleful Shrieks of their Children
and Servants, Tormented by Invisible Hands, with
Tortures altogether preternatural. After the
Mischiefs there Endeavoured, and since in part
Conquered, the terrible Plague, of <i>Evil Angels</i>,
hath made its Progress into some other places,
where other Persons have been in like manner
Diabolically handled. These our poor Afflicted
Neighbours, quickly after they become <i>Infected</i>
and <i>Infested</i> with these <i>Dæmons</i>, arrive to a Capacity
of Discerning those which they conceive the
<i>Shapes</i> of their Troublers; and notwithstanding
the Great and Just Suspicion, that the <i>Dæmons</i>
might Impose the <i>Shapes</i> of Innocent Persons in
their <i>Spectral Exhibitions</i> upon the Sufferers,
(which may perhaps prove no small part of the
<i>Witch-Plot</i> in the issue) yet many of the Persons
thus Represented, being Examined, several of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>

them have been Convicted of a very Damnable
<i>Witchcraft:</i> yea, more than One <i>Twenty</i> have
<i>Confessed</i>, that they have Signed unto a <i>Book</i>,
which the Devil show'd them, and Engaged in
his Hellish Design of <i>Bewitching</i>, and <i>Ruining</i> our
Land. <i>We</i> [8] know not, at least I know not,
how far the <i>Delusions</i> of Satan may be Interwoven
into some Circumstances of the <i>Confessions;</i> but
one would think, all the Rules of Understanding
Humane Affayrs are at an end, if after so many
most Voluntary Harmonious <i>Confessions</i>, made by
Intelligent Persons of all Ages, in sundry Towns, at
several Times, we must not Believe the <i>main
strokes</i> wherein those <i>Confessions</i> all agree: especially
when we have a thousand preternatural Things
every day before our eyes, wherein the <i>Confessors</i>
do acknowledge their Concernment, and give
Demonstration of their being so Concerned. If
the Devils now can strike the minds of men with
any <i>Poisons</i> of so fine a Composition and Operation,
that Scores of Innocent People shall Unite,
in <i>Confessions</i> of a Crime, which we see actually
committed, it is a thing prodigious, beyond the
Wonders of the former Ages, and it threatens no
less than a sort of a Dissolution upon the World.
Now, by these <i>Confessions</i> 'tis Agreed, <i>That</i> the
Devil has made a dreadful Knot of <i>Witches</i> in the
Country, and by the help of <i>Witches</i> has dreadfully
increased that Knot: <i>That</i> these <i>Witches</i>
have driven a Trade of Commissioning their <i>Confederate
Spirits</i>, to do all sorts of Mischiefs to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Neighbours, whereupon there have ensued such
Mischievous consequences upon the Bodies and
Estates of the Neighbourhood, as could not otherwise
be accounted for: yea, <i>That</i> at prodigious
<i>Witch-Meetings</i>, the Wretches have proceeded so
far, as to Concert and Consult the Methods of
Rooting out the Christian Religion from this
Country, and setting up instead of it, perhaps a
more gross <i>Diabolism</i>, than ever the World saw
before. And yet it will be a thing little short of
<i>Miracle</i>, if in so <i>spread</i> a Business as this, the
Devil should not get in some of his Juggles, to
confound the Discovery of all the rest.<a name="FNanchor_55_54" id="FNanchor_55_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_54" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p class="p2">§ III. Doubtless, the Thoughts of many will
receive a great Scandal against <i>New-England</i>, from
the Number of Persons that have been Accused,
or Suspected, for <i>Witchcraft</i>, in this Country: But
it were easie to offer many things, that may
Answer and Abate the Scandal. If the Holy
God should any where permit the Devils to hook
two or three wicked <i>Scholars</i> into <i>Witchcraft</i>, and
then by their Assistance to Range with their
<i>Poisonous Insinuations</i> among Ignorant, Envious,
Discontented People, till they have cunningly
decoy'd them into some sudden <i>Act</i>, whereby the
Toyls of Hell shall be perhaps inextricably cast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>over them: what Country in the World would
not afford <i>Witches</i>, numerous to a Prodigy? Accordingly,
The Kingdoms of <i>Sweden</i>, <i>Denmark</i>,
<i>Scotland</i>, yea and <i>England</i> it self, as well as the
Province of <i>New-England</i>,<a name="FNanchor_56_55" id="FNanchor_56_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_55" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> have had their Storms
of <i>Witchcrafts</i> breaking upon them, which have
made most Lamentable Devastations: which also
I wish, may be <i>The Last</i>. And it is not uneasie
to be imagined, that God has not brought out all
the <i>Witchcrafts</i> in many other Lands with such
a speedy, dreadful, destroying <i>Jealousie</i>, as burns
forth upon such <i>High Treasons</i>, committed here
in <i>A Land of Uprightness:</i> Transgressors may
more quickly here than elsewhere become a Prey
to the Vengeance of Him, <i>Who has Eyes like a
Flame of Fire</i>, and, <i>who walks in the midst of the
Golden Candlesticks</i>. Moreover, There are many
parts of the World, who if they do upon this
Occasion insult over this People of God, need
only to be told the Story of what happen'd at <i>Loim</i>,
in the Duchy of <i>Gulic</i>, where a Popish Curate
having ineffectually try'd many Charms to Eject
the Devil out of a Damsel there possessed, he passionately
bid the Devil come out of her into
himself; but the Devil answered him, <i>Quid mihi
Opus, est eum tentare, quem Novissimo die, Jure Optimo,
sum possessurus?</i> That is, <i>What need I meddle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>with one whom I am sure to have, and hold at the
Last-day as my own for ever!</i></p>

<p>[9] But besides all this, give me leave to add, it
is to be hoped, That among the Persons represented
by the <i>Spectres</i> which now afflict our
Neighbours, there will be found <i>some</i> that never
explicitly contracted with any of the <i>Evil Angels</i>.
The Witches have not only intimated, but some
of them acknowledged, That they have plotted
the Representations of <i>Innocent Persons</i>, to cover
and shelter themselves in their Witchcrafts; now,
altho' our good God has hitherto generally preserved
us from the Abuse therein design'd by the
Devils for us, yet who of us can exactly state,
<i>How far our God may for our Chastisement permit
the Devil to proceed in such an Abuse?</i> It was the
Result of a Discourse, lately held at a Meeting of
some very Pious and Learned Ministers among
us, <i>That the Devils may sometimes have a permission
to Represent an Innocent Person, as Tormenting such
as are under Diabolical Molestations: But that such
things are Rare and Extraordinary; especially when
such matters come before Civil Judicature.</i><a name="FNanchor_57_56" id="FNanchor_57_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_56" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The
Opinion expressed with so much Caution and
Judgment, seems to be the prevailing Sense of
many others, who are men Eminently Cautious
and Judicious; and have both <i>Argument</i> and
<i>History</i> to Countenance them in it. It is <i>Rare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>

and Extraordinary</i>, for an Honest <i>Naboth</i> to have
his Life it self Sworn away by two <i>Children of
Belial</i>, and yet no Infringement hereby made on
the Rectoral Righteousness of our Eternal Soveraign,
whose <i>Judgments are a Great Deep</i>, and
who <i>gives none Account of His matters</i>.<a name="FNanchor_58_57" id="FNanchor_58_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_57" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Thus,
although the Appearance of Innocent Persons in
<i>Spectral Exhibitions</i> afflicting the Neighbourhood,
be a thing <i>Rare and Extraordinary;</i> yet
who can be sure, that the great <i>Belial</i> of Hell
must needs be always <i>Yoked</i> up from this piece of
Mischief? The best man that ever lived has been
called a <i>Witch:</i> and why may not this too usual
and unhappy Symptom of A <i>Witch</i>, even a Spectral
Representation, befall a person that shall be
none of the worst? Is it not possible? The
<i>Laplanders</i> will tell us 'tis possible: for Persons
to be unwittingly attended with officious <i>Dæmons</i>,
bequeathed unto them, and impos'd upon them,
by Relations that have been <i>Witches</i>.<a name="FNanchor_59_58" id="FNanchor_59_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_58" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> <i>Quæry</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>also, Whether at a Time, when the Devil with
his Witches are engag'd in a War upon a people,
some certain steps of ours, in such a War, may
not be follow'd with our appearing so and so for
a while among them in the Visions of our afflicted
<i>Forlorns!</i> And, Who can certainly say, what
other Degrees or Methods of sinning, besides that
of a <i>Diabolical Compact</i>, may give the Devils advantage
to act in the Shape of them that have
miscarried? Besides what may happen for a
while, to try the <i>Patience</i> of the Vertuous. May
not some that have been ready upon feeble
grounds uncharitably to Censure and Reproach
other people, be punished for it by <i>Spectres</i> for a
while exposing them to Censure and Reproach?
And furthermore, I pray, that it may be considered,
Whether a World of Magical Tricks often
used in the World, may not insensibly oblige
<i>Devils</i> to wait upon the Superstitious Users of
them. A Witty Writer against <i>Sadducism</i> has
this Observation, That persons who never made
any express Contract with <i>Apostate Spirits</i>, yet
may Act strange Things by <i>Diabolick Aids</i>, which
they procure by the use of those wicked <i>Forms</i>
and <i>Arts</i>, that the Devil first imparted unto his
Confederates. And he adds, <i>We know not but the
Laws of the Dark Kingdom may Enjoyn a particular
Attendance upon all those that practice their
Mysteries, whether they know them to be theirs or no</i>.
Some of them that have been cry'd out upon as
<i>Employing Evil Spirits</i> to hurt our Land, have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>

been known to be most bloody <i>Fortune-Tellers;</i>
and some of them have confessed, That when they
told <i>Fortunes</i>, they would pretend the Rules of
<i>Chiromancy</i> and the like Ignorant Sciences, but
indeed they had no Rule (they said) [10] but this,
<i>The things were then Darted into their minds</i>.
<i>Darted!</i> Ye Wretches;<a name="FNanchor_60_59" id="FNanchor_60_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_59" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> By whom, I pray?
Surely by none but the <i>Devils;</i> who, tho' perhaps
they did not exactly <i>Foreknow</i> all the thus Predicted
Contingencies; yet having once <i>Foretold</i>
them, they stood bound in Honour now to use
their Interest, which alas, in <i>This World</i>, is very
great, for the Accomplishment of their own
Predictions. There are others, that have used
most wicked <i>Sorceries</i> to gratifie their unlawful
Curiosities, or to prevent Inconveniencies in Man
and Beast; <i>Sorceries</i>, which I will not <i>Name</i>, lest
I should by naming, <i>Teach them</i>.<a name="FNanchor_61_60" id="FNanchor_61_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_60" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Now, some
<i>Devil</i> is evermore Invited into the Service of the
Person that shall Practise these <i>Witchcrafts;</i> and
if they have gone on Impenitently in these Communions
with any <i>Devil</i>, the <i>Devil</i> may perhaps
become at last a <i>Familiar</i> to them, and so assume
their <i>Livery</i>, that they cannot shake him off in
any way, but that One, which I would most
heartily prescribe unto them, Namely, That of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>deep and long <i>Repentance</i>. Should these <i>Impieties</i>
have been committed in such a place as <i>New-England</i>,
for my part I should not wonder, if
when <i>Devils</i> are Exposing the <i>Grosser</i> Witches
among us, God permit them to bring in these
<i>Lesser</i> ones with the rest for their perpetual Humiliation.
In the Issue therefore, may it not be
found, that <i>New-England</i> is not so stock'd with
<i>Rattle Snakes</i>, as was imagined.<a name="FNanchor_62_61" id="FNanchor_62_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_61" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p class="p2">§ IV. But I do not believe, that the progress of
<i>Witchcraft</i> among us, is all the Plot which the
Devil is managing in the <i>Witchcraft</i> now upon
us. It is judged, That the Devil rais'd the Storm,
whereof we read in the Eighth Chapter of
<i>Matthew</i>, on purpose to over-set the little Vessel
wherein the Disciples of Our Lord were Embarqued
with Him. And it may be fear'd, that
in the <i>Horrible Tempest</i> which is now upon ourselves,
the design of the Devil is to sink that
Happy Settlement of Government, wherewith
Almighty God has graciously enclined Their
Majesties to favour us.<a name="FNanchor_63_62" id="FNanchor_63_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_62" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> We are blessed with a
<span class="smcap">Governour</span>, than whom no man can be more
willing to serve Their Majesties, or this their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>Province: He is continually venturing his <i>All</i> to
do it: and were not the Interests of his Prince
dearer to him than his own, he could not but soon
be weary of the <i>Helm</i>, whereat he sits. We are
under the Influence of a <span class="smcap">Lieutenant Governour</span>,<a name="FNanchor_64_63" id="FNanchor_64_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_63" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
who not only by being admirably
accomplished both with Natural and Acquired
Endowments, is fitted for the Service of Their
Majesties, but also with an unspotted Fidelity
applies himself to that Service. Our <span class="smcap">Councellours</span>
are some of our most Eminent Persons,
and as Loyal Subjects to the Crown, as hearty
lovers of their Country.<a name="FNanchor_65_64" id="FNanchor_65_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_64" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Our Constitution also
is attended with singular Priviledges; All which
Things are by the Devil exceedingly <i>Envy'd</i> unto
us. And the Devil will doubtless take this occasion
for the raising of such complaints and clamours,
as may be of pernicious consequence unto some
part of our present Settlement, if he can so far
<i>Impose</i>. But that which most of all Threatens
us, in our present Circumstances, is the <i>Misunderstanding</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>

and so the <i>Animosity</i>, whereunto the
<i>Witchcraft</i> now Raging, has Enchanted us. The
Embroiling, first, of our <i>Spirits</i>, and then of our
<i>Affairs</i>, is evidently as considerable a Branch of
the Hellish Intrigue which now vexes us as any
one Thing whatever. The Devil has made us
like a <i>Troubled Sea</i>, and the <i>Mire</i> and <i>Mud</i> begins
now also to heave up apace. Even Good
and Wise Men suffer themselves to fall into their
<i>Paroxysms;</i> and the Shake which the Devil is now
giving us, fetches up the <i>Dirt</i> which before lay
still at the bottom of our sinful Hearts. If we
allow the Mad Dogs of Hell to poyson us by
biting us, [11] we shall imagine that we see nothing
but such things about us, and like such things fly
upon all that we see. Were it not for what is <small>IN
US</small>, for my part, I should not fear a thousand
Legions of Devils: 'tis by our Quarrels that we
spoil our Prayers; and if our humble, zealous, and
united Prayers are once hindred: Alas, the <i>Philistines</i>
of Hell have cut our Locks for us; they
will then blind us, mock us, ruine us: In truth, I
cannot altogether blame it, if People are a little
transported, when they conceive all the secular
Interests of themselves and their Families at the
Stake; and yet at the sight of these Heartburnings,
I cannot forbear the Exclamation of the Sweet-spirited
<i>Austin</i>, in his Pacificatory Epistle to <i>Jerom</i>,
on the Contest with <i>Ruffin</i>, <i>O misera &amp; miseranda
Conditio!</i> O Condition, truly miserable! But
what shall be done to cure these Distractions? It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
is wonderfully necessary, that some healing Attempts
be made at this time: And I must needs
confess (if I may speak so much) like a <i>Nazianzen</i>,
I am so desirous of a share in them, that if, being
thrown overboard, were needful to allay the <i>Storm</i>,
I should think Dying, a Trifle to be undergone,
for so great a Blessedness.<a name="FNanchor_66_65" id="FNanchor_66_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_65" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p class="p2">§ V. I would most importunately in the first
place, entreat every Man to maintain an holy
Jealousie over his own Soul at this time, and think;
May not the Devil make me, though ignorantly
and unwillingly, to be an Instrument of doing
something that he would have to be done? For
my part, I freely own my Suspicion, lest something
of Enchantment, have reach'd more Persons
and Spirits among us, than we are well aware of.
But then, let us more generally agree to maintain
a kind Opinion one of another. That Charity
without which, even our giving our Bodies to be
burned would profit nothing, uses to proceed by
this Rule; It is kind, it is not easily provok'd, it
thinks no Evil, it believes all things, hopes all
things. But if we disregard this Rule of Charity,
we shall indeed give our Body Politick to be
burned.<a name="FNanchor_67_66" id="FNanchor_67_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_66" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> I have heard it affirmed, That in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
 late great Flood upon <i>Connecticut</i>, those Creatures
which could not but have quarrelled at another
time, yet now being driven together very agreeably
stood by one another.<a name="FNanchor_68_67" id="FNanchor_68_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_67" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> I am sure we shall be
worse than <i>Bruitish</i> if we fly upon one another at
a time when the Floods of Belial make us afraid.
On the one side; [Alas, my Pen, must thou write
the word, <i>Side</i> in the Business?] There are very
worthy Men, who, having been call'd by God,
when and where this Witchcraft first appeared
upon the Stage to encounter it, are earnestly
desirous to have it sifted unto the bottom of it.
And I pray, which of us all that should live
under the continual Impressions of the Tortures,
Outcries, and Havocks which Devils confessedly
Commissioned by Witches make among their
distressed Neighbours, would not have a Biass that
way beyond other Men? Persons this way disposed
have been Men eminent for Wisdom and
Vertue, and Men acted by a noble Principle of
Conscience. Had not Conscience (of Duty to
God) prevailed above other Considerations with
them, they would not for all they are worth in
the World have medled in this Thorny business.
Have there been any disputed Methods used in
discovering the Works of Darkness? It may be
none but what have had great Precedents in other
parts of the World; which may, though not altogether
justifie, yet much alleviate a Mistake in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>

us if there should happen to be found any such
mistake in so dark a Matter.<a name="FNanchor_69_68" id="FNanchor_69_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_68" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> They have done
what they have done, with multiplied Addresses
to God for his Guidance, and have not been insensible
how [12] much they have exposed themselves
in what they have done. Yea, they would
gladly contrive and receive an expedient, how the
shedding of Blood, might be spared, by the Recovery
of Witches, not gone beyond the Reach of
Pardon. And after all, they invite all good Men,
in terms to this purpose, 'Being amazed at the
Number and Quality of those accused of late, we
do not know but Satan by his Wiles may have
enwrapped some innocent Persons; and therefore
should earnestly and humbly desire the most
Critical Enquiry upon the place, to find out the
Falacy; that there may be none of the Servants
of the Lord, with the worshippers of <i>Baal</i>.' I
may also add, That whereas, if once a Witch do
ingeniously confess among us, no more <i>Spectres</i>
do in their Shapes after this, trouble the Vicinage;
if any guilty Creatures will accordingly to so good
purpose confess their Crime to any Minister of
God, and get out of the Snare of the Devil, as no
Minister will discover such a Conscientious Confession,
so I believe none in the Authority will
press him to discover it; but rejoyc'd in a Soul
sav'd from Death. On the other side [if I must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
again use the word <i>Side</i>, which yet I hope to live
to blot out] there are very worthy Men, who are
not a little dissatisfied at the Proceedings in the
Prosecution of this Witchcraft. And why? Not
because they would have any such abominable
thing, defended from the Strokes of Impartial
Justice. No, those Reverend Persons who gave
in this Advice unto the Honourable Council;
'That Presumptions, whereupon Persons may be
Committed, and much more Convictions, whereupon
Persons may be Condemned, as guilty of
Witchcrafts, ought certainly to be more considerable
than barely the Accused Persons being
represented by a <i>Spectre</i> unto the Afflicted; Nor
are Alterations made in the Sufferers, by a Look
or Touch of the Accused, to be esteemed an
infallible Evidence of Guilt; but frequently
liable to be abused by the Devils Legerdemains:'
I say, those very Men of God most conscientiously
Subjoined this Article to that Advice,&mdash;'Nevertheless
we cannot but humbly recommend <span class="errauthor" title="read: unto">unto
unto</span> the Government, the speedy and vigorous
Prosecution of such as have rendred themselves
Obnoxious; according to the best Directions
given in the Laws of God, and the wholsome
Statutes of the <i>English</i> Nation for the Detection
of Witchcraft.' Only 'tis a most commendable
Cautiousness, in those gracious Men, to be very
shye lest the Devil get so far into our Faith, as
that for the sake of many Truths which we find
he tells us, we come at length to believe any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>

Lyes, wherewith he may abuse us: whereupon,
what a Desolation of Names would soon ensue,
besides a thousand other pernicious Consequences?
and lest there should be any such Principles taken
up, as when put into Practice must unavoidably
cause the <i>Righteous to perish with the Wicked;</i> or
procure the Bloodshed of any Persons, like the
<i>Gibeonites</i>, whom some learned Men suppose to be
under a false Notion of Witches, by <i>Saul</i> exterminated.</p>

<p>They would have all due steps taken for the
Extinction of Witches; but they would fain have
them to be sure ones; nor is it from any thing,
but the real and hearty goodness of such Men,
that they are loth to surmise ill of other Men,
till there be the fullest Evidence for the surmises.
As for the Honourable Judges that have been
hitherto in the Commission, they are above my
Consideration: wherefore I will only say thus
much of them, That such of them as I have the
Honour of a Personal Acquaintance with, are
Men of an excellent Spirit; and as at first they
went about the work for which they were Commission'd,
with [13] a very great aversion, so they
have still been under Heart-breaking Solicitudes,
how they might therein best serve both God and
Man? In fine, Have there been faults on any
side fallen into? Surely, they have at worst been
but the faults of a well-meaning Ignorance. On
every side then, why should not we endeavour
with amicable Correspondencies, to help one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
another out of the Snares wherein the Devil
would involve us? To wrangle the Devil out of
the Country, will be truly a New Experiment:
Alas! we are not aware of the Devil, if we do
not think, that he aims at inflaming us one against
another; and shall we suffer our selves to be
Devil-ridden? or by any unadvisableness contribute
unto the Widening of our Breaches?</p>

<p>To say no more, there is a published and
credible Relation; which affirms, That very
lately in a part of <i>England</i>, where some of the
Neighbourhood were quarrelling, a <i>Raven</i> from
the Top of a Tree very articulately and unaccountably
cry'd out, <i>Read the Third of Collossians
and the Fifteenth!</i> Were I my self to chuse what
sort of Bird I would be transformed into, I would
say, <i>O that I had wings like a Dove!</i> Nevertheless,
I will for once do the Office, which as it
seems, Heaven sent that Raven upon; even to
beg, <i>That the Peace of God may Rule in our
Hearts</i>.</p>


<p class="p2">§ VI. 'Tis necessary that we unite in every
thing: but there are especially two Things
wherein our Union must carry us along together.
We are to unite in our Endeavours to deliver our
distressed Neighbours, from the horrible Annoyances
and Molestations with which a dreadful
Witchcraft is now persecuting of them. To
have an hand in any thing, that may stifle or
obstruct a Regular Detection of that Witchcraft,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
is what we may well with an holy fear avoid.
Their Majesties good Subjects must not every
day be torn to pieces by horrid Witches, and
those bloody Felons, be left wholly unprosecuted.
The Witchcraft is a business that will
not be sham'd, without plunging us into sore
Plagues, and of long continuance.<a name="FNanchor_70_69" id="FNanchor_70_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_69" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> But then
we are to unite in such Methods for this deliverance,
as may be unquestionably safe, lest <i>the
latter end be worse than the beginning</i>. And here,
what shall I say? I will venture to say thus
much, That we are safe, when we make just as
much use of all Advice from the invisible World,
as God sends it for. It is a safe Principle, That
when God Almighty permits any Spirits from the
unseen Regions, to visit us with surprizing Informations,
there is then something to be enquired
after; we are then to enquire of one another,
What Cause there is for such things? The peculiar
Government of God, over the unbodied
Intelligences, is a sufficient Foundation for this
Principle. When there has been a Murder
committed, an Apparition of the slain Party accusing
of any Man, altho' such Apparitions have
oftner spoke true than false, is not enough to
Convict the Man as guilty of that Murder; but
yet it is a sufficient occasion for Magistrates to
make a particular Enquiry, whether such a Man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>

have afforded any ground for such an Accusation.
Even so a Spectre exactly resembling such or such
a Person, when the Neighbourhood are tormented
by such Spectres, may reasonably make Magistrates
inquisitive whether the Person so represented
have done or said any thing that may argue
their confederacy with Evil Spirits, altho' it may
be defective enough in point of Conviction;
especially at a time, when 'tis possible, some over-powerful
Conjurer may have got the skill of thus
exhibiting the Shapes of all sorts of Persons, on
purpose to stop the Prosecution of the Wretches,
whom due Enquiries thus provoked, might have
made obnoxious unto Justice.</p>

<p>[14] <i>Quœre</i>, Whether if God would have us to
proceed any further than bare <i>Enquiry</i>, upon what
Reports there may come against any Man, from
the World of <i>Spirits</i>, he will not by his Providence
at the same time have brought into our
hands, these more evident and sensible things,
whereupon a man is to be esteemed a Criminal.
But I will venture to say this further, that it will
be safe to account the Names as well as the Lives
of our Neighbors; two considerable things to be
brought under a Judicial Process, until it be found
by Humane Observations that the Peace of Mankind
is thereby disturbed. We are Humane
Creatures, and we are safe while we say, they
must be Humane Witnesses, who also have in
the particular Act of Seeing, or Hearing, which
enables them to be Witnesses, had no more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>

Humane Assistances, that are to turn the Scale
when Laws are to be executed. And upon this
Head I will further add: A wise and a just Magistrate,
may so far give way to a common Stream
of Dissatisfaction, as to forbear acting up to the
heighth of his own Perswasion, about what may
be judged convictive of a Crime, whose Nature
shall be so abstruse and obscure, as to raise much
Disputation. Tho' he may not do what he should
leave undone, yet he may leave undone something
that else he could do, when the Publick
Safety makes an <i>Exigency</i>.</p>

<p class="p2">§ VII. I was going to make one Venture more;
that is, to offer some safe Rules, for the finding
out of the Witches, which are at this day our
accursed Troublers: but this were a Venture too
<i>Presumptuous</i> and <i>Icarian</i> for me to make; I leave
that unto those Excellent and Judicious Persons,
with whom I am not worthy to be numbred: All
that I shall do, shall be to lay before my Readers,
a brief <i>Synopsis</i> of what has been written on that
Subject, by a Triumvirate of as Eminent Persons
as have ever handled it. I will begin with,</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<p><a name="Footnote_44_43" id="Footnote_44_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_43"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> Probably the same whose Name

<i>that</i> required pretty strong Assurances
on the Part of the prominent
Men of New England, to gain it
Credence among the Officials in
Old England; for not long before an
Agent of Massachusetts had asserted
that "the Acts of that Colony were
not subject to any reëxamination in
England;" and a Writer of 1688
that "till the Reign of his present
Majesty, <span class="err" title="original: Jame">James</span> II, New England
would never submit to any Governor
sent from England, but lived like a

abridged was&mdash;<i>Memorable Providences

that that great Man was as much

was often attempted by the more
catholic Portion of the Community,
and as often defeated by the more

Country, when all, or nearly all
were within the Pale of the Church,
or directly under the Eye of the
Minister or a Magistrate, there was
little Need of Courts, Constables
and Lawyers; but in a growing
Community those Days must necessarily
be of limited Duration; and
as there never was a Community of
any considerable Numbers, in Times
past, wherein there were no <i>Monsters
or Goblins</i>, such a Community
is hardly to be expected to be found
in Time to come.</p></div>

to resent being taunted with Faults,

While a few will reform the many
will cling to Error with more Tenacity.
Thus the enormous Crime
of Slavery&mdash;few Men were so depraved
by Nature as to maintain
that it was right, in reasoning with
themselves; while, when it was
harshly denounced as a vile Felony, Anger took the Place of Reason in
the Slaveholder, and here Argument
only served to rivet firmer
the Fetters intended to be removed.
So it was with other less heinous
Offences.</p></div>

the Witches of Lapland. Although
the Laplanders are described
as a miserable Race, they could not
have been much behind the English
in Matters of Superstition at this
Period. Dr. Heylyn says the Laplanders,

<h3>AN ABSTRACT OF MR. PERKINS'S<a name="FNanchor_71_70" id="FNanchor_71_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_70" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
<br />WAY FOR THE DISCOVERY<br />
OF WITCHES.</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>

I. <span class="smcap">There</span> <i>are</i> Presumptions, <i>which do at least
probably and conjecturally note one to be a</i> Witch.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
<i>These give occasion to Examine, yet they are no
sufficient Causes of Conviction.</i></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>

II. <i>If any Man or Woman be notoriously defamed
for a</i> Witch, <i>this yields a strong Suspition. Yet the
Judge ought carefully to look, that the Report be
made by</i> Men <i>of Honesty and Credit.</i></p>

<p>III. <i>If a</i> Fellow-Witch, <i>or</i> Magician, <i>give
Testimony of any Person to be a</i> Witch; <i>this indeed
is not sufficient for Condemnation; but it is a fit
Presumption to cause a straight Examination.</i></p>

<p>IV. <i>If after Cursing there follow Death, or at
least some mischief: for</i> Witches <i>are wont to practise
their mischievous Facts by Cursing and Banning:
This also is a sufficient matter of Examination, tho'
not of Conviction.</i></p>

<p>V. <i>If after Enmity, Quarrelling, or Threatning,
a present mischief does follow; that also is a great
Presumption.</i></p>

<p>[15] VI. <i>If the Party suspected be the Son or
Daughter, the man-servant or maid-servant, the
Familiar Friend, near Neighbor, or old Companion,
of a known and convicted Witch; this may be likewise
a Presumption; for Witchcraft is an Art that may
be learned, and conveyed from man to man.</i></p>

<p>VII. <i>Some add this for a Presumption: If the
Party suspected be found to have the Devil's mark;
for it is commonly thought, when the Devil makes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>

his Covenant with them, he alwaies leaves his mark
behind them, whereby he knows them for his own:&mdash;a
mark whereof no evident Reason in Nature can be
given.</i></p>

<p>VIII. <i>Lastly, If the party examined be Unconstant,
or contrary to himself, in his deliberate
Answers, it argueth a Guilty Conscience, which
stops the freedom of Utterance. And yet there are
causes of Astonishment, which may befal the Good,
as well as the Bad.</i></p>

<p>IX. <i>But then there is a</i> Conviction, <i>discovering
the</i> Witch, <i>which must proceed from just and
sufficient proofs, and not from bare presumptions.</i></p>

<p>X. <i>Scratching of the suspected party, and Recovery
thereupon, with several other such weak
Proofs; as also, the fleeting of the suspected Party,
thrown upon the Water; these Proofs are so far
from being sufficient, that some of them are, after a
sort, practices of Witchcraft.</i></p>

<p>XI. <i>The Testimony of some Wizzard, tho' offering
to shew the Witches Face in a Glass: This, I grant,
may be a good Presumption, to cause a strait Examination;
but a sufficient Proof of Conviction it
cannot be. If the Devil tell the Grand Jury, that
the person in question is a Witch, and offers withal
to confirm the same by Oath, should the Inquest receive
his Oath or Accusation to condemn the man?
Assuredly no. And yet, that is as much as the Testimony
of another Wizzard, who only by the Devil's
help reveals the Witch.</i></p>

<p>XII. <i>If a man, being dangerously sick, and like to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
dy, upon Suspicion, will take it on his Death, that
such an one hath bewitched him, it is an Allegation of
the same nature, which may move the Judge to
examine the Party, but it is of no moment for Conviction.</i></p>

<p>XIII. <i>Among the sufficient means of Conviction,
the first is, the free and voluntary Confession of the
Crime, made by the party suspected and accused,
after Examination. I say not, that a bare confession
is sufficient, but a Confession after due Examination,
taken upon pregnant presumptions.
What needs now more witness or further Enquiry?</i></p>

<p>XIV. <i>There is a second sufficient Conviction, by
the Testimony of two Witnesses, of good and honest
Report, avouching before the Magistrate, upon their
own Knowledge, the two things: either that the party
accused hath made a League with the Devil, or hath
done some known practices of witchcraft. And,</i> all
Arguments that do necessarily prove either of
these, <i>being brought by two sufficient Witnesses, are
of force fully to convince the party suspected.</i></p>

<p>XV. <i>If it can be proved, that the party suspected
hath called upon the</i> Devil, <i>or desired his
Help, this is a pregnant proof of a League formerly
made between them.</i></p>

<p>XVI. <i>If it can be proved, that the party hath
entertained a Familiar Spirit, and had Conference
with it, in the likeness of some visible Creatures;
here is Evidence of witchcraft.</i></p>

<p>XVII. <i>If the witnesses affirm upon Oath, that the
suspected person hath done any action or work which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>

necessarily infers a Covenant made, as, that he hath
used En-[16]chantments, divined things before they
come to pass, and that peremptorily, raised Tempests,
caused the Form of a dead man to appear; it
proveth sufficiently, that he or she is a</i> Witch.<a name="FNanchor_72_71" id="FNanchor_72_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_71" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
This is the Substance of Mr. <i>Perkins</i>.</p>

<p class="p4">'Take next the Sum of Mr. <i>Gaules</i><a name="FNanchor_73_72" id="FNanchor_73_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_72" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Judgment
about the Detection of Witches. 1. Some
Tokens for the Trial of Witches are altogether
unwarrantable. Suchare the old Paganish Sign,
the Witches <i>Long Eyes;</i> the Tradition of Witches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>not weeping; the casting of the Witch into the
Water, with Thumbs and Toes ty'd a-cross. And
many more such Marks, which if they are to
know a Witch by, certainly 'tis no other Witch,
but the User of them. 2. There are some
Tokens for the Trial of Witches, more probable,
and yet not so certain as to afford Conviction.
Such are strong and long Suspicion: Suspected
Ancestors, some appearance of Fact, the Corps
bleeding upon the Witches touch, the Testimony
of the Party bewitched, the supposed
Witches unusual Bodily marks, the Witches
usual Cursing and Banning, the Witches lewd
and naughty kind of Life. 3. Some Signs there
are of a Witch, more certain and infallible. As,
<i>firstly</i>, Declining of Judicature, or faultering,
faulty, unconstant, and contrary Answers, upon
judicial and deliberate examination. <i>Secondly</i>,
When upon due Enquiry into a person's Faith
and Manners, there are found <i>all</i> or <i>most</i> of the
Causes which produce Witchcraft, namely,
<i>God</i> forsaking, <i>Satan</i> invading, particular <i>Sins</i>
disposing; and lastly, a compact compleating all.
<i>Thirdly</i>, The Witches free Confession, together
with full Evidence of the Fact. <i>Confession</i> without
<i>Fact</i> may be a meer Delusion, and <i>Fact</i>
without <i>Confession</i> may be a meer Accident.
<i>4thly</i>, The semblable Gestures and Actions of
suspected Witches, with the comparable Expressions
of Affections, which in all Witches have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
been observ'd and found very much alike.
<i>Fifthly</i>, The Testimony of the Party bewitched,
whether pining or dying, together with the joynt
Oaths of sufficient persons, that have seen certain
prodigious Pranks or Feats, wrought by the Party
accused. 4. Among the most unhappy circumstances
to convict a Witch, one is, a maligning
and oppugning the Word, Work, and Worship
of God, and by any extraordinary sign seeking
to seduce any from it. See <i>Deut.</i> 13. 1, 2,
<i>Mat.</i> 24. 24. <i>Act.</i> 13. 8, 10. 2 <i>Tim.</i> 3. 8. Do
but mark well the places, and for this very
Property (of thus opposing and perverting) they
are all there concluded arrant and absolute
Witches. 5. It is not requisite, that so <i>palpable
Evidence of Conviction</i> should here come in, as in
other more sensible matters; 'tis enough, if there
be but so much <i>circumstantial</i> Proof or Evidence,
as the Substance, Matter, and Nature of such an
abstruse Mystery of Iniquity will well admit.
[<i>I suppose he means, that whereas in other Crimes
we look for more direct proofs, in this there is a
greater use of consequential ones.</i>] 'But I could
heartily wish, that the Juries were empanell'd
of the most eminent Physicians, Lawyers, and
Divines that a Country could afford. In the
mean time 'tis not to be called a Toleration, if
Witches escape, where Conviction is wanting.
To this purpose our <i>Gaule</i>.'</p>

<p>I will transcribe a little from one Author more,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
'tis the Judicious <i>Bernard</i> of <i>Batcomb</i>,<a name="FNanchor_74_73" id="FNanchor_74_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_73" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> who in
his <i>Guide to grand Jurymen</i>, after he has mention'd
several things that are shrewd Presumptions of a
Witch, proceeds to such things as are the <i>Convictions</i>
of such an one. And he says, '<i>A witch
in league with the</i> Devil <i>is convicted by</i> [1]<a name="FNanchor_75_74" id="FNanchor_75_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_74" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> <i>these
Evidences;</i> I. By a witches <i>Mark;</i> which is on
the Baser sort of Witches; and this, by the Devils
either Sucking or Touching of them. <i>Tertullian</i>
says, <i>It is the Devils custome to mark his</i>. And
note, That this mark is <i>Insensible</i>, and being
prick'd it will not Bleed. Sometimes, its like a
<i>Teate;</i> sometimes but a <i>Blewish Spot;</i> sometimes
a <i>Red</i> one; and sometimes the <i>flesh Sunk:</i> but
the Witches do sometimes cover them. II. By
the Witches <i>Words</i>. As when they have been
heard calling on, speaking to, or Talking of
their <i>Familiars;</i> or, when they have been heard
<i>Telling</i> of <i>Hurt</i> they have done to man or
beast: Or when they have been heard <i>Threatning</i>
of such Hurt; Or if they have been heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Relating their <i>Transportations</i>. III. By the
Witches <i>Deeds</i>. As when they have been <i>seen</i>
with their Spirits, or seen secretly Feeding any
of their <i>Imps</i>. Or, when there can be found
their Pictures, Poppets, and other Hellish Compositions.
IV. By the Witches <i>Extasies:</i> With
the Delight whereof, Witches are so taken, that
they will hardly conceal the same: Or, however
at some time or other, they may be found in
them. V. By one or more <i>Fellow-Witches</i>,
Confessing their own Witchcraft, and bearing
Witness against others; if they can make good
the Truth of their Witness, and give sufficient
proof of it. As, that they have seen them with
their Spirits or, that they have Received Spirits
from them; or that they can tell, when they
used Witchery-Tricks to Do Harm; or, that
they told them what Harm they had done; or
that they can show the mark upon them; or,
that they have been together in their Meetings;
and such like. VI. By some <i>Witness of God</i>
Himself, happening upon the Execrable Curses
of Witches upon themselves, Praying of God to
show some Token, if they be Guilty. VII. By
the Witches own <i>Confession</i>, of Giving their Souls
to the Devil. It is no Rare thing, for Witches
to Confess.'</p>

<p>They are Considerable Things, which I have
thus Recited; and yet it must be with <i>Open Eyes</i>,
kept upon <i>Open Rules</i>, that we are to follow these
things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>

<i>S.</i> 8. But <i>Juries</i> are not the only Instruments
to be imploy'd in such a Work; all <i>Christians</i> are
to be concerned with daily and fervent <i>Prayers</i>,
for the assisting of it. In the Days of <i>Athanasius</i>,
the Devils were found unable to stand before
that <i>Prayer</i>, however then used perhaps with too
much of Ceremony, <i>Let God Arise, Let his Enemies
be scattered</i>. <i>Let them also that Hate Him,
flee before Him.</i></p>

<p>O that instead of letting our Hearts <i>Rise</i> against
one another, our Prayers might <i>Rise</i> unto an high
pitch of Importunity, for such a <i>Rising</i> of the
Lord! Especially, Let them that are <i>Suffering</i>
by <i>Witchcraft</i>, be sure to <i>stay</i> and <i>pray</i>, and <i>Beseech
the Lord thrice</i>, even as much as ever they
can, before they complain of any Neighbour for
afflicting them. Let them also that are <i>accused</i>
of <i>Witchcraft</i>, set themselves to <i>Fast</i> and <i>Pray</i>,
and so shake off the <i>Dæmons</i> that would like
<i>Vipers</i> fasten upon them; and get the <i>Waters of
Jealousie</i> made profitable to them.</p>

<p>And Now, O <i>Thou Hope of</i> New-England,
<i>and the Saviour thereof in the Time of Trouble; Do
thou look mercifully down upon us, &amp; Rescue us, out
of the Trouble which at this time do's threaten to
swallow us up. Let Satan be shortly bruised under
our Feet, and Let the Covenanted Vassals of
Satan, which have Traiterously brought him in upon
us, be Gloriously Conquered, by thy Powerful and
Gracious Presence in the midst of us. Abhor us
not, O God, but cleanse us, but heal us, but save us,</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
<i>for the sake of thy Glory. Enwrapped in our Salvations.
By thy Spirit, Lift up a standard against
our infernal adversaries, Let us quickly find thee
making of us glad, according to the Days wherein
we have been afflicted. Accept of all our Endeavours
to glorify thee, in the Fires that are upon us; and
among the rest, Let these my poor and weak essays,
composed with what Tears, what Cares, what
Prayers, thou</i> only <i>knowest, not want the Acceptance

<p><a name="Footnote_71_70" id="Footnote_71_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_70"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> The same "Master William
Perkins," I suppose, who wrote the
three stout Folios of Puritan Theology,
published in 1606, besides
many smaller Works. The earliest
Notice I find of him is by another
equally famous and voluminous
Puritan, the Rev. Samuel Clark, in
his <i>Marrow of Ecclesiastical History</i>,
published in 1650. Mr. Clark informs
us that William Perkins was
born at Marston in Warwickshire,
in 1558, was educated at "<i>Christ's</i>
College in <i>Cambridg</i>," and that in
the 24th of <i>Elizabeth</i>, he was
chosen a Fellow of that College,
and that "hee was very wilde in
his Youth." From his Professorship,
"hee was chosen to <i>Saint Andrews</i>
Parish in <i>Cambridg</i>, where he
preached all his Life after. His
Sermons were not so plain, but the
piously learned did admire them;
nor so learned, but the plain did
understand them: Hee brought the
Schools into the Pulpit, and unshelling
their Controversies out of
their hard School-tearms, made
thereof plain and wholsom Meat for
his People: He was an excellent
Chirurgion at the jointing of a
broken Soul, and at stating of a
doubtful Conscience. In his Sermons
hee used to pronounce the
Word <i>Damn</i> with such an Emphasis,
as left a dolefull Echo in his
Auditor's Ears a good while after:
and when hee was Catechist in
Christ's College, in expounding the
Commandments, hee applied them
so Home to the Conscience as was
able to make his Hearers Harts fall
down, and their Hairs almost to
stand upright."
</p>
<p>
On Reference to the Works of
famous Thomas Fuller, it will be
found, that in his Life of Perkins
he has substantially the same Account.
From that Author Mr.
Clark doubtless borrowed the Expressions
used by him, as Fuller's
Work was published several Years
before, and they seem peculiar to
that highly talented Writer. Clark
is followed because he was of the
same religious Denomination as Mr.
Perkins. Mr. Clark continues: "In
his Life hee was so pious and spotless,
that Malice was afraid to bite
at his Credit, into which shee knew
that her Teeth could not enter:
Hee had a rare Felicitie in reading of Books, and as it were but turning
them over would give an exact
account of all that was considerable
therein: hee perused Books so
speedily that one would think that
hee read nothing, and yet so accurately
that one would think he read
all: Besides his frequent Preaching,
hee wrote manie excellent Books,
both Treatises, and Commentaries,
which for their Worth were manie
of them translated into Latine, and
sent beyond Sea, where to this
Daie they are highly prized, and
much set by, yea some of them are
translated into <i>French</i>, <i>High-Dutch</i>,
and <i>Low-Dutch:</i> and his
reformed Catholick was translated
into <i>Spanish;</i> yet no Spaniard
ever since durst take up the Gantlet
of Defiance cast down by this
Champion."
</p>
<p>
But there is one Fact mentioned
by Fuller which Mr. Clark omits:
"There goeth," he says, "an uncontrolled
Tradition, that Perkins,
when a young Scholar, was a great
Studier of Magic, occasioned perchance
by his Skill in the Mathematics.
For, ignorant People count
all Circles above their own Sphere
to be Conjring; and presently cry
out, 'those Things are done by
Black Art' for which their dim
Eyes can see no Colour in Reason.
And in such Case, when they cannot
fly up to Heaven to make it a
Miracle, they fetch it from Hell
to make it Magic, though it may
lawfully be done by natural Causes."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Perkins died "in the fourtieth
Year of his Age, <i>Anno</i> 1602,
being born the first, and dying the
last Year of [the Reign of] Elizabeth:
He was of a ruddie Complexion,
fat and corpulent: Lame of
his right Hand, yet this <i>Ehud</i> with
a left-handed Pen did stab the
Romish Caus&mdash;as one faith: [Hugh
Holland]

<div class="i0">'Though Nature thee of thy right Hand bereft.</div>
<div class="i0">'Right well thou writest with thy Hand that's left.'</div>
</div></div>
 </div>
<p>
"Hee was buried with great Solemnity
at the sole Charges of
Christs College, the Universitie, and
Town striving which should express
more Sorrow thereat: Doctor <i>Montague</i>,
afterwards Bishop of Winchester
preached his Funeral Sermon."&mdash;<i>Marrow
of Ecclesiastical
Historie</i>, 414-417, and Fuller's
<i>Holy and Profane State</i>, 80-84.
</p>
<p>
The well known Rev. Mr. Job
Orton speaks of the Folios of Perkins
with Delight, and adds:
"What led me more particularly to
read him was, that his Elder Brother
was one of my Ancestors, from
whom I am in a direct Line, by
my Mother's Side descended."&mdash;Orton,
in <i>Brook's Lives</i>, ii, 135.
In his Will, dated 16 Oct., 1602,
he mentions, among others, Nathaniel
Cradock, his Brother-in-law,
Wife Timothye, Father and Mother
Thomas and Anna Perkins, Son-in-law,
John Hinde, and Brethren and
Sisters, but not by Name.&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>
</p>
<p>
I have been more particular in
this Notice of Perkins for two
Reasons; first, because of his Puritanism
he was selected as a prime
Authority in Matters of Witchcraft
by our Author; and second, because
he seems to have been a Man possessing
that Precocity of Mind, and in
other respects was similarly gifted.
To those desirous of learning more of
that noted Puritan Leader will find
Gratification in the excellent and
elaborate Life of him in Brook's
<i>Lives of the Puritans</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_72_71" id="Footnote_72_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_71"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> On perusing these Articles for
the Detection of Witches, one cannot
escape the Conviction that on
their being sifted by the ordinary
Rules of Common-sense, they actually
amount to nothing at all. Thus
in Article VI it is laid down, that
"Witchcraft is an Art, that may
be learned, and conveyed from
Man to Man." This Postulate
follows of course, previously assuming
that the Occult Sciences originate
in Mathematics; and further, that
Mathematical Calculations are inseparable
from the Laws that govern
the whole System of the Universe,
and hence emanate from, or are a
Part of the Creator himself. Whence
then, with this inevitable Conclusion,
does the "Art" originate?
Nothing can be clearer, therefore,
than this,&mdash;if those learned Plodders
of Master Perkins's Time had followed
out the most simple Rules of
Logic, they would have had neither
Witch nor Devil wherewith to addle
their own Brains, or to confound
those of the unlearned Multitude.
This Question being disposed of,
all others having Dependence on it,
or traceable to it, effectually dispose
of the whole Question of Witchcraft.</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Revel.</span> xii. 12.
</p>

<p class="hang"><i>Wo to the Inhabitants of the Earth, and of the

Fiery Pillar, vouchsafed unto <i>Israel</i>,
in the Wilderness of old;
there is a very <i>dark side</i> of it in
the Intimation, that, <i>The Devil
is come down having great Wrath;</i>
but it has also a <i>bright side</i>, when
it assures us, that, <i>He has but a short time;</i> Unto
the Contemplation of <i>both</i>, I do this Day Invite
you.</p>

<p>We have in our Hands a Letter from our
Ascended Lord in Heaven, to Advise us of his
being still alive, and of his Purpose e're long, to
give us a Visit, wherein we shall see our Living
<i>Redeemer, stand at the latter day upon the Earth</i>.
'Tis the last Advice that we have had from
Heaven, for now sixteen Hundred years; and the
scope of it, is, to represent how the Lord Jesus
Christ having begun to set up his Kingdom in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
the World, by the preaching of the Gospel, he
would from time to time utterly break to pieces
all Powers that should make Head against it, until,
<i>The Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdomes
of our Lord, and of his</i> [3] <i>Christ, and he
shall Reign for ever and ever</i>. 'Tis a Commentary
on what had been written by <i>Daniel</i>, about, <i>The
fourth Monarchy;</i> with some Touches upon, <i>The
Fifth;</i> wherein, <i>The greatness of the Kingdom under
the whole Heaven, shall be given to the people of the
Saints of the most High:</i> And altho' it have, as
'tis expressed by one of the Ancients, <i>Tot Sacramenta
quot verba</i>, a Mystery in every Syllable, yet
it is not altogether to be neglected with such a
Despair, as that, <i>I cannot read, for the Book is
sealed</i>. It is a <span class="smcap">Revelation</span>, and a singular, and
notable <i>Blessing</i> is pronounced upon them that
humbly study it.</p>

<p>The Divine Oracles, have with a most admirable
Artifice and Carefulness, drawn, as the very
pious <i>Beverley</i>, has laboriously Evinced, an exact
<span class="smcap">Line of Time</span>, from the first Sabbath at the
<i>Creation</i> of the World, unto the great Sabbatism
at the <i>Restitution</i> of all Things. In that famous
<i>Line of Time</i>, from the Decree for the Restoring
of <i>Jerusalem</i>, after the Babylonish Captivity, there
seem to remain a matter of <i>Two Thousand and
Three Hundred Years</i>, unto that <i>New Jerusalem</i>,
whereto the Church is to be advanced, when the
Mystical <i>Babylon</i> shall be <i>fallen</i>. At the Resurrection
of our Lord, there were seventeen or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
eighteen Hundred of those Years, yet upon the
Line, to run unto, <i>The rest which remains for the
People of God;</i> and this Remnant in the <i>Line of
Time</i>, is here in our <i>Apocalypse</i>, variously Embossed,
Adorned, and Signalized with such Distinguishing
Events, if we mind them, will help
us escape that Censure, <i>Can ye not Discern the
Signs of the Times?</i></p>

<p>The Apostle <i>John</i>, for the View of these
Things, had laid before him, as I conceive, a
<i>Book</i>, with leaves, or folds; which <i>Volumn</i> was
written both on the <i>Backside</i>, and on the <i>Inside</i>,
and Roll'd up in a Cylindriacal Form, under
seven <i>Labels</i>, fastned with so many <i>Seals</i>. The
first <i>Seal</i> being opened, and the first <i>Label</i> removed,
under the first <i>Label</i> the Apostle saw
what he saw, of a first <i>Rider</i> Pourtray'd, and so
on, till the last <i>Seal</i> was broken up; each of the
Sculptures being enlarged with agreeable <i>Visions</i>
and <i>Voices</i>, to illustrate it. The Book being now
Unrolled, there were <i>Trumpets</i>, with wonderful
Concomitants, Exhibited successively on the Expanding
<i>Backside</i> of it. Whereupon the Book
was <i>Eaten</i>, as it were to be Hidden, from Interpretations;
till afterwards, in the <i>Inside</i> of it, the
Kingdom of Anti-christ came to be Exposed.
Thus, the Judgments of God on the <i>Roman
Empire</i>, first unto the Downfal of <i>Paganism</i>, and
then, unto the Downfal of <i>Popery</i>, which is but
Revived <i>Paganism</i>, are in these Displayes, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Lively Colours and Features made sensible unto
us.</p>

<p>[4] Accordingly, in the Twelfth Chapter of
this Book, we have an August Preface, to the
Description of that Horrid <i>Kingdom</i>, which our
Lord Christ refused, but Antichrist accepted,
from the Devils Hands; a Kingdom, which for
<i>Twelve Hundred and Sixty</i> Years together, was to
be a continual oppression upon the People of God,
and opposition unto his Interests; until the Arrival
of that Illustrious Day, wherein, <i>The Kingdom
shall be the Lords, and he shall be Governour
among the Nations</i>. The Chapter is (as an Excellent
Person calls it) an <i>Extravasated Account</i>
of the Circumstances, which befell the <i>Primitive
Church</i>, during the first Four or Five Hundred
Years of Christianity: It shows us the Face of
the Church, first in <i>Rome</i> Heathenish, and then
in Rome Converted, before the <i>Man of Sin</i> was
yet come to <i>Mans Estate</i>. Our Text contains
the Acclamations made upon the most Glorious
Revolution that ever yet happened upon the
Roman Empire; namely, That wherein the
Travailing Church brought forth a Christian
Emperour. This was a most Eminent <i>Victory</i>
over the Devil, and <i>Resemblance</i> of the State,
wherein the World, ere long shall see, <i>The Kingdom
of our God, and the Power of his Christ</i>. It is
here noted,</p>

<p>First, As a matter of <i>Triumph</i>. 'Tis said, <i>Rejoyce,
ye Heavens, and ye that dwell in them</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Saints in both Worlds, took the Comfort of this
Revolution; the Devout Ones that had outlived
the late Persecutions, were filled with Transporting
Joys, when they saw the <i>Christian</i> become the
<i>Imperial</i> Religion, and when they saw Good Men
come to give Law unto the rest of Mankind; the
Deceased Ones also, whose Blood had been Sacrificed
in the Ten Persecutions, doubtless made the
Light Regions to ring with <i>Hallelujahs</i> unto
God, when there were brought unto them, the
Tidings of the Advances now given to the
<i>Christian</i> Religion, for which they had suffered
<i>Martyrdom</i>.</p>

<p>Secondly, As a matter of <i>Horror</i>. 'Tis said,
<i>Wo to the Inhabiters of the Earth and of the Sea</i>.
The <i>Earth</i> still means the <i>False Church</i>, the <i>Sea</i>
means the <i>Wide World</i>, in Prophetical Phrasæology.
There was yet left a vast party of Men,
that were Enemies to the Christian Religion, in
the power of it; a vast party left for the Devil
to work upon: Unto these is a <i>Wo</i> denounced;
and why so? 'Tis added, <i>For the Devil is come
down unto you, having great Wrath, because he
knows, that he has but a short time</i>. These were,
it seems, to have some desperate and peculiar
Attempts of the Devil made upon them. In the
mean time, we may entertain this for our Doctrine.</p>

<p><i>Great Wo proceeds from the Great</i> <span class="smcap">Wrath</span>, <i>with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
which</i> [5] <i>the</i> <span class="smcap">Devil</span>, <i>towards the end of his</i> <span class="smcap">Time</span>,
<i>will make a</i> <span class="smcap">Descent</span> <i>upon a miserable World.</i></p>

<p>I have now Published a most awful and solemn
Warning for our selves at this day; which has
four <i>Propositions</i>, comprehended in it.</p>

<p><i>Proposition I.</i> That there is a <i>Devil</i>, is a thing
Doubted by none but such as are under the Influence
of the <i>Devil</i>. For any to deny the Being
of a <i>Devil</i> must be from an Ignorance or Profaneness,
worse than <i>Diabolical</i>. <i>A Devil.</i> What is
<i>that?</i> We have a Definition of the Monster, in
<i>Eph.</i> 6. 12. <i>A Spiritual Wickedness</i>, that is, <i>A
wicked Spirit</i>. A Devil is a <i>Fallen Angel</i>, an Angel
<i>Fallen</i> from the Fear and Love of God, and from
all Celestial Glories; but <i>Fallen</i> to all manner of
Wretchedness and Cursedness. He was once in
that Order of Heavenly Creatures, which God in
the Beginning made <i>Ministering Spirits</i>, for his
own peculiar Service and Honour, in the management
of the Universe; but we may now write
that Epitaph upon him, <i>How art thou fallen from
Heaven! thou hast said in thine Heart, I will Exalt
my Throne above the Stars of God; but thou art
brought down to Hell!</i> A Devil is a <i>Spiritual</i> and
<i>Rational Substance</i>, by his <i>Apostacy</i> from God, inclined
to all that is Vicious, and for that <i>Apostacy</i>
confined unto the Atmosphere of this Earth, <i>in
Chains, under Darkness, unto the Judgment of the
Great Day</i>. This is a <i>Devil;</i> and the <i>Experience</i>
of Mankind as well as the <i>Testimony</i> of Scripture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
does abundantly prove the Existence of such a
Devil.<a name="FNanchor_78_77" id="FNanchor_78_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_77" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>About this <i>Devil</i>, there are many things,
whereof we may reasonably and profitably be
Inquisitive; such things, I mean, as are in our
Bibles Reveal'd unto us; according to which if
we do not speak on so <i>dark</i> a Subject, but according
to our own uncertain, and perhaps humoursome
Conjectures, <i>There is no Light in us</i>. I will
carry you with me, but unto one Paragraph of
the Bible, to be informed of three Things, relating
to the <i>Devil;</i> 'tis the Story of the <i>Gadaren
Energumen</i>, in the fifth Chapter of <i>Mark</i>.</p>

<p>First, then, 'Tis to be granted; the <i>Devils</i> are
so many, that some Thousands, can sometimes
at once apply themselves to vex one Child of
Man. It is said, in Mark 5. 15. <i>He that was
Possessed with the Devil, had the Legion.</i> Dreadful
to be spoken! A <i>Legion</i> consisted of Twelve
Thousand Five Hundred People: And we see
that in one Man or two, so many <i>Devils</i> can be
spared for a Garrison. As the Prophet cryed out,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span><i>Multitudes, Multitudes, in the Valley of Decision!</i>
So I say, <i>There are multitudes, multitudes, in the
valley of Destruction, where the Devils are!</i> When
[6] we speak of, <i>The Devil</i>, 'tis, <i>A name of Multitude;</i>
it means not <i>One</i> Individual Devil, so Potent
and Scient, as perhaps a <i>Manichee</i> would imagine;
but it means a <i>Kind</i>, which a <i>Multitude</i>
belongs unto. Alas, the <i>Devils</i>, they swarm about
us, like the <i>Frogs of Egypt</i>, in the most Retired
of our Chambers. Are we at our <i>Boards?</i> There
will be Devils to Tempt us unto Sensuality: Are
we in our <i>Beds?</i> There will be Devils to Tempt
us unto Carnality; Are we in our <i>Shops?</i> There
will be Devils to Tempt us unto Dishonesty.
Yea, Tho' we get into the Church of God, there
will be Devils to Haunt us in the very <i>Temple</i> it
self, and there tempt us to manifold Misbehaviours.
I am verily perswaded, That there are
very few Humane Affairs whereinto some Devils
are not Insinuated; There is not so much as a
<i>Journey</i> intended, but <i>Satan</i> will have an hand in
<i>hindering</i> or <i>furthering</i> of it.</p>

<p>Secondly, 'Tis to be supposed, That there is a
sort of Arbitrary, even Military <i>Government</i>, among
the <i>Devils</i>. This is intimated, when in <i>Mar.</i> 5.
9. <i>The unclean Spirit said, My Name is Legion:</i>
they are under such a Discipline as <i>Legions</i> use
to be. Hence we read about, <i>The Prince of the
power of the Air:</i> Our <i>Air</i> has a <i>power?</i> or an
Army of Devils in the <i>High Places</i> of it; and
these Devils have a <i>Prince</i> over them, who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
<i>King over the Children of Pride</i>. 'Tis probable,
That the Devil, who was the Ringleader of that
mutinous and rebellious Crew, which first shook
off the Authority of God, is now the General of
those Hellish Armies;<a name="FNanchor_79_78" id="FNanchor_79_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_78" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Our Lord, that Conquered
him, has told us the Name of him; 'tis
<i>Belzebub;</i> 'tis he that is <i>the Devil</i>, and the rest
are <i>his Angels</i>, or his Souldiers. Think on vast
Regiments of cruel and bloody <i>French Dragoons</i>,
with an <i>Intendant</i> over them, overrunning a pillaged
Neighbourhood, and you will think a little,
what the Constitution among the <i>Devils</i> is.</p>

<p>Thirdly, 'tis to be supposed, that some Devils
are more peculiarly <i>Commission'd</i>, and perhaps
<i>Qualify'd</i>, for some Countries, while others are
for others. This is intimated when in <i>Mar.</i> 5.
10. The Devils <i>besought</i> our Lord much, <i>that he
would not send them away out of the Countrey</i>.
Why was that? But in all probability, because
<i>these Devils</i> were more able <i>to do the works of the
Devil</i>, in such a Countrey, than in another. It
is not likely that every Devil does know every
<i>Language;</i> or that every Devil can do every <i>Mischief</i>.<a name="FNanchor_80_79" id="FNanchor_80_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_79" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
'Tis possible, that the <i>Experience</i>, or, if I
may call it so, the <i>Education</i> of all Devils is not
alike, and that there may be some difference in
their <i>Abilities</i>. If one might make an Inference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>from what the Devils <i>do</i>, to what they <i>are</i>, One
cannot [7] forbear dreaming, that there are <i>degrees</i>
of Devils. Who can allow, that such Trifling
<i>Dæmons</i>, as that of <i>Mascon</i>,<a name="FNanchor_81_80" id="FNanchor_81_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_80" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> or those that
once infested our <i>New berry</i>, are of so much
Grandeur, as those <i>Dæmons</i>, whose Games are
mighty Kingdoms? Yea, 'tis certain, that all
Devils do not make a like Figure in the <i>Invisible
World</i>. Nor does it look agreeably, That the
<i>Dæmons</i>, which were the Familiars of such a Man
as the old <i>Apollonius</i>, differ not from those baser
Goblins that chuse to Nest in the filthy and loathsom
Rags of a beastly Sorceress. Accordingly,
why may not some Devils be more accomplished
for what is to be done in such and such places,
when others must be <i>detach'd</i> for other Territories?
Each Devil, as he sees his advantage, cries
out, <i>Let me be in this Countrey, rather than another</i>.
But <i>Enough</i>, if not <i>too much</i>, of these things.<a name="FNanchor_82_81" id="FNanchor_82_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_81" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p><i>Proposition II.</i> There is a Devilish <i>Wrath</i>
against <i>Mankind</i>, with which the <i>Devil</i> is for
<i>God's sake</i> Inspired. The Devil is himself broiling
under the intollerable and interminable <i>Wrath</i>
of God; and a fiery <i>Wrath</i> at God, is, that which
the Devil is for that cause Enflamed. Methinks
I see the posture of the Devils in <i>Isa.</i> 8. 21.
<i>They fret themselves, and Curse their God, and look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>upward.</i> The first and chief <i>Wrath</i> of the Devil,
is at the Almighty God himself; he knows, <i>The
God that made him, will not have mercy on him, and
the God that formed him, will shew him no favour;</i>
and so he can have no <i>Kindness</i> for that God,
who has no <i>Mercy</i>, nor <i>Favour</i> for him. Hence
'tis, that he cannot bear the <i>Name</i> of God should
be acknowledged in the World: Every Acknowledgement
paid unto <i>God</i>, is a fresh drop of the
burning Brimstone falling upon the Devil; he
does make his Insolent, tho' Impotent Batteries,
even upon the <i>Throne</i> of God himself: and foolishly
affects to have himself exalted unto that
<i>Glorious High Throne</i>, by all people, as he sometimes
is, by Execrable <i>Witches</i>. This horrible
Dragon does not only with his Tayl strike at the
<i>Stars of God</i>, but at the God himself, who made
the <i>Stars</i>, being desirous to outshine them all.
God and the Devil are sworn Enemies to each
other; the Terms between them, are those, in
<i>Zech.</i> 11. 18. <i>My Soul loathed them, and their Soul
also abhorred me.</i> And from this Furious <i>wrath</i>,
or Displeasure and Prejudice at God, proceeds
the Devils <i>wrath</i> at us, the poor Children of Men.
Our doing the <i>Service</i> of God, is one thing that
exposes us to the <i>wrath</i> of the Devil. We are
the <i>High Priests</i> of the World; when all Creatures
are called upon, <i>Praise ye the Lord</i>, they
bring to us those demanded <i>Praises</i> of God, saying,
<i>do you offer them for us</i>. Hence 'tis, that the
Devil has a Quarrel with [8] us, as he had with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
the <i>High-Priest</i> in the Vision of Old. Our bearing
the Image of God is another thing that brings
the <i>wrath</i> of the Devil upon us. As a <i>Tyger</i>,
thro' his Hatred at man will tear the very Picture
of him, if it come in his way; such a <i>Tyger</i> the
Devil is; because God said of old, <i>Let us make
Man in our Image</i>, the Devil is ever saying, <i>Let
us pull this man to pieces</i>. But the envious <i>Pride</i>
of the Devil, is one thing more that gives an Edge
unto his Furious <i>Wrath</i> against us. The Apostle
has given us an hint, as if <i>Pride</i> had been the
<i>Condemnation of the Devil</i>. 'Tis not unlikely, that
the Devil's <i>Affectation</i> to be above that Condition
which he might learn that Mankind was to be
preferr'd unto, might be the <span class="errauthor" title="read: occasion">occcasion</span> of his
taking up Arms against the <i>Immortal King</i>.
However, the Devil now sees <i>Man</i> lying in the
Bosom of God, but <i>himself</i> damned in the bottom
of Hell; and this enrages him exceedingly; <i>O</i>,
says he, <i>I cannot bear it, that man should not be as
miserable as my self</i>.</p>

<p><i>Proposition III.</i> The <i>Devil</i>, in the prosecution,
and the execution of his <i>wrath</i> upon them, often
gets a <i>Liberty</i> to make a <i>Descent</i> upon the Children
of men. When the Devil <i>does hurt</i> unto us,
he <i>comes down</i> unto us; for the Rendezvouze of
the <i>Infernal Troops</i>, is indeed in the <i>supernal parts</i>
of our Air.<a name="FNanchor_83_82" id="FNanchor_83_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_82" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> But as 'tis said, <i>A sparrow of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>Air does not fall down without the will of God;</i> so I
may say, <i>Not a Devil in the Air, can come down
without the leave of God</i>. Of this we have a famous
Instance in that Arabian Prince, of whom the
Devil was not able so much as to <i>Touch</i> any thing,
till the most high God gave him a permission, to
<i>go down</i>.<a name="FNanchor_84_83" id="FNanchor_84_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_83" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The Devil stands with all the Instruments
of death, aiming at us, and begging of the
Lord, as that King ask'd for the Hood-wink'd
<i>Syrians</i> of old, <i>Shall I smite 'em, shall I smite 'em?</i>
He cannot strike a blow, till the Lord say, <i>Go
down and smite</i>, but sometimes he <i>does</i> obtain from
the <i>high possessor of Heaven and Earth</i>, a License
for the doing of it. The Devil sometimes does
make most rueful Havock among us; but still
we may say to him, as our Lord said unto a great
Servant of his, <i>Thou couldst have no power against
me, except it were given thee from above</i>.<a name="FNanchor_85_84" id="FNanchor_85_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_84" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The
Devil is called in 1 <i>Pet.</i> 5. 8. <i>Your Adversary.</i>
This is a Law-term; and it notes <i>An Adversary
at Law</i>. The Devil cannot come at us, except
in some sence according to <i>Law;</i> but sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>he does procure sad things to be inflicted, according
to the <i>Law of</i> the eternal King upon us. The
Devil first <i>goes up</i> as an <i>Accuser</i> against us. He
is therefore styled <i>The Accuser;</i> and it is on
this account, that his proper Name does belong
unto him. There is a Court somewhere kept;
a Court of Spirits, where the Devil enters all sorts
of Complaints [9] against us all; he charges us
with manifold <i>sins</i> against the Lord our God:
<i>There</i> he loads us with heavy <i>Imputations</i> of Hypocrysie,
Iniquity, Disobedience; whereupon he
urges, <i>Lord, let 'em now have the death, which is their
wages, paid unto 'em!</i> If our <i>Advocate</i> in the
Heavens do not now take off his Libel; the Devil,
then, with a Concession of God, <i>comes down</i>, as a
<i>destroyer</i> upon us. Having first been an <i>Attorney</i>,
to bespeak that the Judgments of Heaven may
be ordered for us, he then also pleads, that he
may be the <i>Executioner</i> of those Judgments; and
the God of Heaven sometimes after a sort, signs
a Warrant, for this <i>destroying Angel</i>, to do what
has been <i>desired</i> to be done for the <i>destroying of
men</i>. But such a <i>permission</i> from God, for the
Devil to <i>come down</i>, and <i>break in</i> upon mankind,
oftentimes must be accompany'd with a <i>Commission</i>
from some wretches of mankind it self. Every
man is, as 'tis hinted in <i>Gen.</i> 4. 9. <i>His brother's
keeper</i>. We are to <i>keep</i> one another from the
Inroads of the Devil, by mutual and cordial
Wishes of prosperity to one another. When ungodly
people give their <i>Consents</i> in <i>witchcrafts</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
diabolically performed, for the Devil to annoy
their Neighbours, he finds a breach made in the
Hedge about us, whereat he Rushes in upon us,
with grievous molestations. Yea, when the impious
people, that never saw the Devil, do but
utter their <i>Curses</i> against their Neighbours, those
are so many <i>watch words</i>, whereby the Mastives
of Hell are animated presently to fall upon us.
Tis thus, that the Devil gets <i>leave</i> to worry us.</p>

<p><i>Proposition IV.</i> Most horrible <i>woes</i> come to be
inflicted upon Mankind, when the <i>Devil</i> does in
<i>great wrath</i>, make a <i>descent</i> upon them. The
<i>Devil</i> is a <i>Do-Evil</i>, and wholly set upon mischief.
When our Lord once was going to <i>Muzzel</i> him,
that he might not mischief others, he cry'd out,
<i>Art thou come to torment me?</i> He is, it seems,
himself <i>Tormented</i>, if he be but <i>Restrained</i> from
the tormenting of Men. If upon the sounding
of the Three last <i>Apocalyptical Angels</i>, it was an
outcry made in Heaven, <i>Wo, wo, wo, to the inhabitants
of the Earth by reason of the voice of the
Trumpet</i>. I am sure, a <i>descent</i> made by the Angel
of <i>death</i>, would give cause for the like Exclamation:
<i>Wo to the world, by reason of the wrath of the
Devil!</i> what a <i>woful</i> plight, mankind would by
the descent of the Devil be brought into, may be
gathered from the <i>woful</i> pains, and wounds, and
hideous desolations which the Devil brings upon
them, with whom he has with a <i>bodily Possession</i>
made a Seisure. You may both in Sacred and
Profane History, read many a direful Account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
the <i>woes</i>, which they that are possessed by the
Devil, do undergo: And from thence conclude,
<i>What</i> [10] <i>must the Children of Men hope from such
a Devil!</i> Moreover, the <i>Tyrannical Ceremonies</i>,
whereto the Devil uses to subjugate such <i>Woful</i>
Nations or Orders of Men, as are more Entirely
under his Dominion, do declare what <i>woful</i> Work
the Devil would make where he comes. The
very Devotions of those forlorn <i>Pagans</i>, to whom
the Devil is a Leader, are most bloody <i>Penances;</i>
and what <i>Woes</i> indeed must we expect from such
a Devil of a <i>Moloch</i>, as relishes no Sacrifices like
those of Humane Heart-blood, and unto whom
there is no Musick like the bitter, dying, doleful
Groans, ejaculated by the Roasting Children of
Men.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the servile, abject, needy circumstances
wherein the Devil keeps the Slaves,
that are under his more sensible Vassalage, do
suggest unto us, how <i>woful</i> the Devil would render
all our Lives. We that live in a Province,
which affords unto us all that may be necessary
or comfortable for us, found the Province fill'd
with vast Herds of Salvages, that never saw so
much as a <i>Knife</i>, or a <i>Nail</i>, or a <i>Board</i>, or a Grain
of <i>Salt</i>, in all their Days. No better would the
Devil have the World provided for. Nor should
we, or any else, have one convenient thing about
us, but be as indigent as <i>usually</i> our most <i>Ragged
Witches</i> are; if <i>the Devil's Malice</i> were not overruled
by a <i>compassionate God</i>, who <i>preserves Man</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
<i>and Beast</i>. Hence 'tis, that <i>the Devil</i>, even like a
<i>Dragon</i>, keeping a Guard upon such <i>Fruits</i> as
would <i>refresh</i> a languishing World, has hindred
Mankind for many Ages, from hitting upon those
<i>useful Inventions</i>, which yet <i>were so obvious</i> and <i>facil</i>,
that it is every bodies wonder, they were no
sooner hit upon. The <i>bemisted World</i>, must jog
on for thousands of Years, without the knowledg
of <i>the Loadstone</i>, till a <i>Neapolitan</i> stumbled upon
it, about <i>three hundred years</i> ago. Nor must the
World be <i>blest</i> with such a <i>matchless Engine</i> of
<i>Learning</i> and <i>Vertue</i>, as that of <i>Printing</i>, till about
<i>the middle of the Fifteenth Century</i>. Nor could
<i>One Old Man, all over the Face of the whole Earth</i>,
have the <i>benefit</i> of such a <i>Little</i>, tho' most <i>needful</i>
thing, as a pair of <i>Spectacles</i>, till a <i>Dutch-Man</i>, a
<i>little while</i> ago accommodated us.<a name="FNanchor_86_85" id="FNanchor_86_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_85" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Indeed, as the Devil does begrutch us all manner
of <i>Good</i>, so he does annoy us with all manner
of <i>Wo</i>, as often as he finds himself capable of doing
it. But shall we mention some of the <i>special
woes</i> with which the Devil does usually infest the
World! Briefly then; <i>Plagues</i> are some of those
<i>woes</i> with which the Devil troubles us. It is said
of the <i>Israelites</i>, in 1 <i>Cor.</i> 10. 10. <i>They were destroyed
of the destroyer</i>. That is, they had <i>the
Plague</i> among them. 'Tis the <i>Destroyer</i>, or <i>the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>Devil</i>, that scatters <i>Plagues</i> about the World.
Pestilential and Contagious Diseases, 'tis the Devil
who does oftentimes invade us with them. 'Tis
no uneasy thing for the Devil to impreg[11]nate
the Air about us, with such Malignant <i>Salts</i>, as
meeting with <i>the Salt</i> of our <i>Microcosm</i>, shall
immediately cast us into that Fermentation and
Putrefaction, which will utterly dissolve all the
Vital Tyes within us; Ev'n as an <i>Aqua-Fortis</i>,
made with a conjunction of <i>Nitre</i> and <i>Vitriol</i>,
Corrodes what it Seizes upon. And when the
Devil has raised those <i>Arsenical Fumes</i>, which
become <i>Venemous Quivers</i> full of <i>Terrible Arrows</i>,
how easily can he shoot the deleterious <i>Miasms</i>
into those Juices or Bowels of Mens Bodies,
which will soon Enflame them with a Mortal
Fire! Hence come such <i>Plagues</i>, as that <i>Beesom
of Destruction</i>, which within our memory swept
away such a Throng of People from one <i>English</i>
City in one Visitation;<a name="FNanchor_87_86" id="FNanchor_87_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_86" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> And hence those Infectious
Fevers, which are but so many <i>Disguised
Plagues</i> among us, causing Epidemical Desolations.
Again, <i>Wars</i> are also some of those <i>Woes</i>,
with which the Devil causes our Trouble. It is
said in <i>Rev.</i> 12. 17. <i>The Dragon was Wrath and
he went to make War;</i> and there is in truth scarce
any <i>War</i>, but what is of the <i>Dragon's</i> kindling.<a name="FNanchor_88_87" id="FNanchor_88_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_87" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>The Devil is that <i>Vulcan</i>, out of whose Forge
come the instruments of our <i>Wars</i>, and it is he
that finds us Employments for those Instruments.
We read concerning <i>Dæmoniacks</i>, or People in
whom the Devil was, that they would cut and
wound themselves; and so, when the Devil is in
Men, he puts 'em upon dealing in that barbarous
fashion with one another. <i>Wars</i> do often furnish
him with some Thousands of Souls in one
Morning from one Acre of Ground; and for the
sake of such <i>Thyestæan</i> Banquets, he will push us
upon as many <i>Wars</i> as he can.</p>

<p>Once more, why may not <i>Storms</i> be reckoned
among those <i>Woes</i>, with which the Devil does
disturb us? It is not improbable that <i>Natural
Storms</i> on the World are often of the Devils
raising. We are told in <i>Job</i> 1. 11, 12, 19. that
the Devil made a <i>Storm</i>, which hurricano'd the
House of <i>Job</i>, upon the Heads of them that were
Feasting in it. <i>Paracelsus</i> could have informed
the Devil, if he had not been informed, as besure
he was before, That if much <i>Aluminious</i> matter,
with <i>Salt Petre</i> not throughly prepared, be mixed,
they will send up a cloud of Smoke, which <i>will</i>
come down in Rain. But undoubtedly the <i>Devil</i>
understands as <i>well</i> the way to make a <i>Tempest</i> as
to turn the <i>Winds</i> at the <i>Solicitation</i> of a <i>Laplander;</i><a name="FNanchor_89_88" id="FNanchor_89_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_88" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
whence perhaps it is, that Thunders are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>observed oftner to break upon <i>Churches</i> than upon
any other <i>Buildings;</i> and besides many a Man,
yea many a Ship, yea, many a Town has miscarried,
when the Devil has been permitted from
above to make an horrible Tempest.<a name="FNanchor_90_89" id="FNanchor_90_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_89" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> However
that the Devil has raised many <i>Metaphorical
Storms</i> upon the Church, is a thing, than which
there is nothing more notorious. It was said
unto Believers in <i>Rev.</i> 2. 10. <i>The Devil shall
cast some of [12] you into Prison</i>. The Devil was
he that at first set <i>Cain upon Abel</i> to butcher him,
as the Apostle seems to suggest, for his Faith in
God, as a <i>Rewarder</i>. And in how many <i>Persecutions</i>,
as well as <i>Heresies</i> has the Devil been
ever since Engaging all the Children of <i>Cain!</i>
That Serpent the Devil has acted his cursed Seed
in unwearied endeavours to have them, <i>Of whom
the World is not worthy</i>, treated as those who are
<i>not worthy to live in the World</i>. By the impulse
of the Devil, 'tis that first the old <i>Heathens</i>, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>then the mad <i>Arians</i> were <i>pricking Briars</i> to the
true Servants of God; and that the <i>Papists</i> that
came after them, have out done them all for
Slaughters, upon those that have been <i>accounted
as the Sheep for the Slaughters</i>. The late <i>French</i>
Persecution is perhaps the horriblest that ever was
in the World:<a name="FNanchor_91_90" id="FNanchor_91_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_90" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> And as the Devil of <i>Mascon</i>
seems before to have meant it in his out-cries
upon <i>the Miseries preparing for the poor Hugonots!</i>
Thus it has been all acted by a singlar
Fury of the old Dragon inspiring of his Emissaries.</p>

<p>But in reality, <i>Spiritual Woes</i> are the <i>principal
Woes</i> among all those that the Devil would have
us undone withal. <i>Sins</i> are the worst of <i>Woes</i>,
and the Devil seeks nothing so much as to plunge
us into Sins. When men do commit a Crime
for which they are to be Indicted, they are
usually <i>mov'd by the Instigation of the Devil</i>. The
Devil will put <i>ill men upon being worse</i>. Was it
not he that said in 1 <i>King.</i> 22. 22. <i>I will go forth,
and be a lying Spirit in the Mouth of all the Prophets?</i>
Even so the Devil becomes an <i>Unclean
Spirit</i>, <i>a Drinking Spirit</i>, <i>a Swearing Spirit</i>, <i>a
Worldly Spirit</i>, <i>a Passionate Spirit</i>, <i>a Revengeful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>Spirit</i>, and the like in the Hearts of those that
are already too much of such a Spirit; and thus
they become improv'd in Sinfulness. Yea, the
Devil will put <i>good men upon doing ill</i>. Thus we
read in 1 <i>Chron.</i> 21. 1. <i>Satan provoked David to
number Israel</i>. And so the <i>Devil provokes</i> men
that are Eminent in Holiness unto such things as
may become eminently Pernicious; he <i>provokes</i>
them especially unto <i>Pride</i>, and unto many unsuitable
Emulations. There are likewise most
lamentable Impressions which the <i>Devil</i> makes
upon the <i>Souls of Men</i> by way of punishment
upon them for their <i>Sins</i>. 'Tis thus when an
Offended God puts the <i>Souls</i> of <i>Men</i> over into
the Hands of that Officer <i>who has the power of
Death, that is, the Devil</i>. It is the woful Misery
of Unbelievers in 2 <i>Cor.</i> 4. 4. <i>The god of this
World has blinded their minds</i>. And thus it may
be said of those woful Wretches whom the <i>Devil</i>
is a God unto, <i>the Devil so muffles them that they
cannot see the things of their peace</i>. And <i>the Devil
so hardens them, that nothing will awaken their
cares about their Souls:</i> How come so many to be
<i>Seared</i> in their Sins? 'Tis the Devil that with a
red hot Iron fetcht from his Hell [13] does <i>cauterise</i>
them. Thus 'tis, till perhaps at last they
come to have a <i>Wounded Conscience</i> in them, and
the Devil has often a share in their Torturing and
confounded Anguishes. The <i>Devil</i> who Terrified
<i>Cain</i>, and <i>Saul</i>, and <i>Judas</i> into Desperation,
still becomes a <i>King of Terrors</i> to many Sinners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
and frights them from laying hold on the Mercy
of God in the Lord Jesus Christ. In these
regards, <i>Wo unto us, when the Devil comes down
upon us</i>.<a name="FNanchor_92_91" id="FNanchor_92_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_91" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p><i>Proposition V.</i> Toward the <i>End</i> of his <i>Time</i> the
<i>Descent</i> of the Devil in <i>Wrath</i> upon the World
will produce more <i>woful Effects,</i> than what have
been in <i>former Ages</i>. The dying Dragon, will
bite more cruelly and sting more bloodily than
ever he did before: The Death-pangs of the
Devil will make him to be more of a <i>Devil</i> than
ever he was; and the Furnace of this <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>
will be heated <i>seven times</i> hotter, just
before its putting out.</p>

<p>We are in the first place to apprehend, that
there is a time fixed and stated by God for the
Devil to enjoy a dominion over our sinful and
therefore woful World. The <i>Devil</i> once exclaimed
in <i>Mat.</i> 8. 29. <i>Jesus, thou Son of God, art
thou come hither to Torment us before our Time?</i> It is
plain, that until the second coming of our Lord
the <i>Devil</i> must have a time of plagueing the
World, which he was afraid would have Expired
at his first. The <i>Devil</i> is <i>by the wrath of God the
Prince of this World;</i> and the time of his Reign
is to continue until the time when our Lord
himself shall <i>take to himself his great Power and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>Reign</i>. Then 'tis that the <i>Devil</i> shall hear the
Son of God swearing with loud Thunders
against him, <i>Thy time shall now be no more!</i> Then
shall the <i>Devil</i> with his Angels receive their
doom, which will be, <i>depart into the everlasting
Fire prepared for you</i>.</p>

<p>We are also to apprehend, that in the <i>mean
time</i>, the Devil can give a shrewd guess, when he
draws near to the <i>End of his Time</i>. When he
saw Christianity enthron'd among the <i>Romans</i>, it
is here said, in our <i>Rev.</i> 12. 12. <i>He knows he hath
but a short time.</i> And how does he <i>know it?</i> Why
<i>Reason</i> will make the Devil to <i>know</i> that God
won't suffer him to have the <i>Everlasting Dominion;</i>
and that when God has once begun to rescue the
World out of his hands, he'll go through with it,
until the <i>Captives of the mighty shall be taken away
and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered</i>. But
the Devil will have <i>Scripture</i> also, to make him
<i>know</i>, that when his Antichristian <i>Vicar</i>, the <i>seven-headed
Beast</i> on the <i>seven-hilled</i> City,<a name="FNanchor_93_92" id="FNanchor_93_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_92" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> shall have
spent his determined years, he with his <i>Vicar</i> must
unavoidably go down into the <i>bottomless Pit</i>. It
is not improbable, that the Devil often hears the
<i>Scripture</i> expounded in our Congregations; yea
that we never assemble without a <i>Satan</i> among
us. As there are some Divines, who do with
more uncertainty conjecture, from a certain place
in the Epistle to the <i>Ephesians</i>, That the Angels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>do sometimes come into our Churches, to gain
some advantage from our Ministry. But be sure
our <i>Demonstrable Interpretations</i> may give Repeated
Notices to the Devil, <i>That his time is almost out;</i>
and what the Preacher says unto the <i>Young Man,
Know thou, that God will bring thee into Judgment!</i>
<span class="smcap">That</span> may our Sermons tell unto the <i>Old Wretch,
Know thou, that the time of thy Judgment is at hand</i>.</p>

<p>But we must now, likewise, apprehend, that in
<i>such a time</i>, the <i>woes</i> of the World will be
heightened, beyond what they were at <i>any time</i>
yet from the foundation of the World. Hence
'tis, that the Apostle has forewarned us, in 2 <i>Tim.</i>
3. 1. <i>this know, that</i> [14] <i>in the last days, perillous
times shall come.</i> Truly, when the Devil <i>knows</i>,
that he is got into his <i>Last days</i>, he will make
<i>perillous times</i> for us; the times will grow more
full of <i>Devils</i>, and therefore more full of <i>Perils</i>,
than ever they were before. Of this, if we would
<i>know</i>, what cause is to be assigned; It is not only,
because the Devil grows more <i>able</i>, and more
<i>eager</i> to vex the World; but also, and chiefly,
because the World is more <i>worthy</i> to be vexed by
the Devil, than ever heretofore. The <i>Sins</i> of
Men in this Generation, will be more <i>mighty Sins</i>,
than those of the former Ages; men will be more
Accurate and Exquisite and Refined in the arts of
<i>Sinning</i>, than they use to be. And besides, their
own sins, the sins of all the former Ages will also
lie upon the sinners of this generation. Do we
ask why the <i>mischievous powers of darkness</i> are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
prevail more in our days, than they did in those
that are past and gone! 'Tis because that men by
sinning over again the sins of the former days,
have a <i>Fellowship with all those unfruitful works of
darkness</i>. As 'twas said in <i>Matth.</i> 23. 36. <i>All these
things shall come upon this generation;</i> so the men of
the last Generation, will find themselves involved
in the guilt of all that went before them. Of
Sinners 'tis said, <i>They heap up Wrath;</i> and the
sinners of the Last Generations do not only add
unto the <i>heap</i> of sin that has been pileing up ever
since the Fall of man, but they Interest themselves
in every sin of that enormous heap. There has
been a Cry of all former ages going up to God,
<i>That the Devil may come down!</i> and the sinners of
the Last Generations, do sharpen and louden that
<i>cry</i>, till the thing do come to pass, as Destructively
as Irremediably. From whence it follows, that
the Thrice Holy God, with his Holy Angels, will
now after a sort more <i>abandon</i> the World, than in
the former ages. The roaring Impieties of the
<i>old World</i>, at last gave mankind such a distast in
the Heart of the Just God, that he came to say,
<i>It Repents me that I have made such a Creature!</i>
And however, it may be but a witty Fancy, in a
late Learned Writer, that the <i>Earth</i> before the
Flood was nearer to the Sun, than it is at this Day;
and that Gods Hurling down the <i>Earth</i> to a further
distance from the <i>Sun</i>, were the cause of that
Flood;<a name="FNanchor_94_93" id="FNanchor_94_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_93" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> yet we may fitly enough say, that men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
perished by a <i>Rejection</i> from the God of Heaven.
Thus the enhanc'd Impieties of this <i>our World</i>,
will Exasperate the Displeasure of God, at such a
rate, as that he will more <i>cast us off</i>, than heretofore;
until at last, he do with a more than ordinary
Indignation say, <i>Go Devils; do you take them,
and make them beyond all former measures miserable!</i></p>

<p>If Lastly, We are inquisitive after Instances of
those aggravated <i>woes</i>, with which the Devil will
towards the <i>End</i> of his <i>Time</i> assault us; let it be
remembered, That all the Extremities which
were foretold by the <i>Trumpets</i> and <i>Vials</i> in the
Apocalyptick Schemes of these things, to come
upon the World, were the <i>woes</i> to come from the
<i>wrath</i> of the Devil, upon the <i>shortning</i> of his
<i>Time</i>. The horrendous desolations that have come
upon mankind, by the Irruptions of the old <i>Barbarians</i>
upon the <i>Roman</i> World, and then of the
<i>Saracens</i>, and since, of the <i>Turks</i>, were such <i>woes</i>
as men had never seen before. The Infandous
<i>Blindness</i> and <i>Vileness</i> which then came upon
mankind, and the Monstrous <i>Croisadoes</i> which
thereupon carried the <i>Roman</i> World by Millions
together unto the Shambles; were also such <i>woes</i>
as had never yet had a Parallel. And yet these
were some of the things here intended, when it
was said, <i>Wo! For the Devil is come down in great
Wrath, having but a short time</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>
<p>But besides all these things, and besides the increase
of <i>Plagues</i> and <i>Wars</i>, and <i>Storms</i>, and <i>Internal
Maladies</i> now in our days, there are especially
two most extraordinary <i>Woes</i>, one would
fear, will in these days become very ordinary.
One <i>Woe</i> that may be look'd for is, A frequent
Repition of <i>Earth-quakes</i>, and this perhaps by the
energy of the Devil in the <i>Earth</i>. The Devil
will be clap't up, as a Prisoner in or near the
Bowels of the earth, when once that <i>Conflagration</i>
shall be dispatched, which will make, <i>The
New Earth wherein shall dwell Righteousness;</i> and
that <i>Conflagration</i> will doubtless be much promoted
by the Subterraneous <i>Fires</i>, which are a
cause of the <i>Earthquakes</i> in our Dayes. Accordingly,
we read, <i>Great Earthquakes in divers
places</i>, enumerated among the Tokens of the
<i>Time</i> approaching, when the Devil shall have no
longer <i>Time</i>. I suspect, That we shall now be
visited with more Usual [15] and yet more Fatal
<i>Earthquakes</i> than were our Ancestors; in asmuch as
the <i>Fires</i> that are shortly to <i>Burn unto the Lowest
Hell, and set on Fire the Foundations of the Mountaions</i>,
will now get more Head than they use to
do; and it is not impossible, that the Devil, who
is ere long to be punished in those <i>Fires</i>, may
aforehand augment his Desert of it, by having an
hand in using some of those <i>Fires</i>, for our Detriment.
Learned Men have made no scruple to
charge the Devil with it; <i>Deo permittente, Terræ
motus causat</i>. The Devil surely, was a party in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
the <i>Earthquake</i>,<a name="FNanchor_95_94" id="FNanchor_95_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_94" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> whereby the Vengeance of God,
in one black Night sunk Twelve considerable
Cities of <i>Asia</i>, in the Reign of <i>Tiberious</i>.<a name="FNanchor_96_95" id="FNanchor_96_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_95" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> But
there will be more such <i>Catastrophe's</i> in our
Dayes; <i>Italy</i> has lately been <i>Shaking</i>, till its
<i>Earthquakes</i> have brought Ruines at once upon
more than thirty Towns; but it will within a
little while, <i>shake</i> again, and <i>shake</i> till the Fire of
God have made an Entire <i>Etna</i> of it. And behold,
This very Morning, when I was intending
to utter among you such Things as these, we are
cast into an <i>Heartquake</i> by Tidings of an <i>Earthquake</i>
that has lately happened at <i>Jamaica:</i> an
horrible <i>Earthquake</i>, whereby the <i>Tyrus</i> of the
English <i>America</i>, was at once pull'd into the Jaws
of the Gaping and Groaning Earth, and many
Hundreds of the Inhabitants buried alive.<a name="FNanchor_97_96" id="FNanchor_97_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_96" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The
Lord sanctifie so dismal a Dispensation of his Providence,
unto all the <i>American</i> Plantations! But
be assured, my Neighbours, the <i>Earthquakes</i> are
not over yet! We have not yet seen <i>the last</i>. And
then, Another <i>Wo</i> that may be Look'd for is,
The Devils being now let Loose in <i>preternatural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>Operations</i> more than formerly; and perhaps in
<i>Possessions</i> and <i>Obsessions</i> that shall be very marvellous.
You are not Ignorant, That just before our
Lords <i>First Coming</i>, there were most observable
Outrages committed by the Devil upon the Children
of Men: And I am suspicious, That there
will again be an unusual Range of the Devil
among us, a little before the <i>Second Coming</i> of our
Lord, which will be, to give the last stroke, in
<i>Destroying the works of the Devil</i>. The <i>Evening
Wolves</i> will be much abroad, when we are near
the <i>Evening</i> of the World. The Devil is going
to be Dislodged of the <i>Air</i>, where his present
Quarters are; God will with flashes of hot <i>Lightning</i>
upon him, cause him to <i>fall as Lightning</i>
from his Ancient Habitations: And the <i>Raised
Saints</i> will there have a <i>New Heaven</i>, which We
<i>expect according to the Promise of God</i>. Now a
little before this thing, you be like to see the
Devil more <i>sensibly</i> and <i>visibly</i> Busy upon <i>Earth</i>
perhaps, than ever he was before. You shall
oftner hear about <i>Apparitions</i> of the Devil, and
about poor people strangely Bewitched, <i>Possessed</i>
and <i>Obsessed</i>, by Infernal Fiends. When our
Lord is going to set up His Kingdom, in the
most <i>sensible</i> and <i>visible</i> manner, that ever was, and
in a manner answering the <i>Transfiguration</i> in <i>the
Mount</i>, it is a Thousand to One, but the Devil
will in sundry <i>parts of the world</i>, assay <i>the like</i> for
Himself, with a most Apish Imitation: and Men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
at least in <i>some</i> Corners of the World, and perhaps
in <i>such</i> as God may have some special Designs
upon, will to their Cost, be more Familiarized
<i>with the World of Spirits</i>, than they had been
formerly.</p>

<p>So that, in fine, if just before <i>the End</i>, when
<i>the times of the</i> Jews were to be finished, a man then
ran about every where, crying, <i>Wo to the Nation!
Wo to the City! Wo to the Temple! Wo! Wo! Wo!</i>
Much more may the descent of the Devil, just
before his <i>End</i>, when also <i>the times of the Gentiles</i>
will be finished, cause us to cry out, <i>Wo! Wo!
Wo! because of the black things that threaten us!</i></p>

<p>But it is now Time to make our Improvement
of what has been said. And, first, we shall entertain
our selves with a few <i>Corollaries</i>, deduced
from what has been thus asserted.</p>

<p><i>Corollary I.</i> What cause have we to bless God,
for our preservation from the <i>Devils wrath</i>, in
this which may too reasonably be called the <i>Devils
World!</i> While we are in <i>this present evil world</i>,
We are continually surrounded with swarms of
those Devils, who make this <i>present world</i>, become
so <i>evil</i>. What a wonder of Mercy is it,
that no <i>Devil</i> could ever yet make a prey of us!<a name="FNanchor_98_97" id="FNanchor_98_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_97" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
We can set our foot no where but we shall tread
in the midst of most Hellish <i>Rattle-Snakes;</i> and
one of those <i>Rattle-Snakes</i> once thro' the mouth
of a Man, on whom he had Seized, hissed out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>such a Truth as this, <i>If God would let me loose upon
you, I should find enough in the Best of you all, to
make you all mine</i>.<a name="FNanchor_99_98" id="FNanchor_99_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_98" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> What shall I say? The <i>Wilderness</i>
thro' which we are passing to the <i>Pro-[16]mised
Land</i>, is all over fill'd with <i>Fiery flying serpents</i>.
But, blessed be God; None of them have
hitherto so fastned upon us, as to confound us
utterly! All our way to Heaven, lies by the
<i>Dens of Lions</i>, and the <i>Mounts of Leopards;</i> there
are incredible Droves of Devils in our way. But
have we safely got on our way thus far? O let
us be thankful to our Eternal preserver for it. It
is said in Psal. 76. 10. <i>Surely the wrath of Man
shall praise thee, and the Remainder of wrath shalt
thou restrain;</i> But <i>surely</i> it becomes to praise God,
in that we have yet sustain'd no more Damage by
the <i>wrath of the Devil</i>, and in that he has restrain'd
that Overwhelming <i>wrath</i>. We are poor, Travellers
in a World, which is as well the Devils
<i>Field</i>, as the Devils <i>Gaol;</i><a name="FNanchor_100_99" id="FNanchor_100_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_99" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> a World in every
Nook whereof the Devil is encamped with <i>Bands
of Robbers</i>, to pester all that have their <i>Face looking
Zion-ward:</i> And are we all this while preserved
from the undoing Snares of the <i>Devil?</i> it
is, <i>Thou, O keeper of Israel, that hast hitherto been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>our Keeper!</i> And therefore, <i>Bless the Lord, O my
soul, Bless his Holy Name, who has redeemed thy
Life from the Destroyer!</i></p>

<p><i>Corollary II.</i> We may see the rise of those
multiply'd, magnify'd, and Singularly-stinged
Afflictions, with which <i>aged</i>, or <i>dying</i> Saints frequently
have their <i>Death</i> Prefaced, and their
<i>Age</i> embittered. When the Saints of God are
going to leave the World, it is usually a more
<i>Stormy World</i> with them, than ever it was; and
they find more <i>Vanity</i>, and more <i>Vexation</i> in the
world than ever they did before. It is true,
<i>That many are the afflictions of the Righteous;</i> but
a little before they bid adieu to all those many
<i>Afflictions</i>, they often have greater, harder, Sorer,
Loads thereof laid upon them, than they had yet
endured. It is true, <i>That thro' much Tribulation
we must enter into the Kingdom of God;</i> but a little
before our <i>Entrance</i> thereinto, our <i>Tribulation</i>
may have some sharper accents of Sorrow, than
ever were yet upon it. And what is the cause of
this? It is indeed the <i>Faithfulness of our God unto
us</i>, that we should find the Earth more full of
<i>Thorns</i> and <i>Briars</i> than ever, just before he fetches
us from <i>Earth</i> to <i>Heaven;</i> that so we may go
away the more willingly, the more easily, and
with less Convulsion, at his calling for us. O
there are <i>ugly Ties</i>, by which we are fastned unto
this world; but God will by <i>Thorns and Briars</i>
tear those <i>Ties</i> asunder. But, <i>is not the Hand of
Joab here?</i> Sure, There is the <i>wrath</i> of the <i>Devil</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
also in it. A little before we step into Heaven,
the <i>Devil</i> thinks with himself, <i>My time to abuse
that Saint is now but short; what Mischief I am to
do that Saint, must be done quickly, if at all; he'l
shortly be out of my Reach for ever.</i> And for
this cause he will now fly upon us with the
Fiercest Efforts and Furies of his <i>Wrath</i>. It was
allowed unto the <i>Serpent</i>, in Gen. 2. 15. To <i>Bruise
the Heel</i>. Why, at the <i>Heel</i>, or at the <i>Close</i>, of
our Lives, the <i>Serpent</i> will be nibbling, more than
ever in our Lives before: and it is <i>Because now
he has but a short time</i>. He knows, That we
shall very shortly be, <i>Where the wicked cease from
Troubling, and where the Weary are at Rest;</i> wherefore
that <i>Wicked</i> one will now <i>Trouble</i> us, more
than ever he did, and we shall have so much
<i>Disrest</i>, as will make us more <i>weary</i> than ever we
were, of things here below.</p>

<p><i>Corollary III.</i> What a Reasonable Thing then
is it, that they whose <i>Time</i> is but <i>short</i>, should
make as great <i>Use</i> of their <i>Time</i>, as ever they
can! I pray, let us learn some <i>good</i>, even from the
<i>wicked One</i> himself. It has been advised, <i>Be wise
as Serpents:</i> why, there is a piece of <i>Wisdom</i>,
whereto that old <i>Serpent</i>, the Devil himself, may
be our Moniter. When the Devil perceives his
<i>Time</i> is but <i>short</i>, it puts him upon <i>Great Wrath</i>.
But how should it be with <i>us</i>, when we perceive
that our <i>Time</i> is but <i>short?</i> why, it should put us
upon <i>Great Work</i>. The motive which makes
the Devil to be more full of <i>wrath;</i> should make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
us more full of <i>warmth</i>, more full of <i>watch</i>, and
more full of <i>All Diligence to make our Vocation,
and Election sure</i>. Our <i>Pace</i> in our Journey
<i>Heaven-ward</i>, must be Quickened, if our <i>space</i>
for that Journey be shortned, even as <i>Israel</i> went
further the <i>two last</i> years of their Journey <i>Canaan-ward</i>,
than they did in 38 years before. The
Apostle brings this, as a <i>spur</i> to the Devotions of
Christians, in 1 <i>Cor.</i> 7. 29. <i>This I say, Brethren,
the time is short.</i> Even so, I <i>say</i> this; some things
I lay before you, which I do only <i>think</i>, or <i>guess</i>,
but here is a thing which I venture to <i>say</i> with
all the [33] freedom imaginable. You have now
a <i>Time</i> to <i>Get</i> good, even a <i>Time</i> to make sure of
<i>Grace and Glory, and every good thing</i>, by true
Repentance: But, <i>This I say, the time is but short</i>.
You have now <i>Time</i> to <i>Do</i> good, even to <i>serve out
your generation</i>, as by the <i>Will</i>, so for the <i>Praise</i>
of God; but, <i>This I say, the time is but short</i>. And
what I say thus to <i>All</i> People, I say to <i>Old</i> People,
with a peculiar Vehemency: Sirs, It cannot be
long before your <i>Time</i> is out; there are but a few
sands left in the glass of your <i>Time:</i> And it is
of all things the saddest, for a man to say, <i>My
time is done, but my work undone!</i> O then, <i>To
work</i> as fast as you can; and of Soul-work, and
Church-work, dispatch as much as ever you can.
Say to all <i>Hindrances</i>, as the gracious <i>Jeremiah
Burroughs</i><a name="FNanchor_101_100" id="FNanchor_101_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_100" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> would sometimes to <i>Visitants: You'll
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>excuse me if I ask you to be short with me, for my work
is great, and my time is but short</i>. Methinks every
<i>time</i> we hear a Clock, or see a Watch, we have
an admonition given us, that our <i>Time</i> is upon
the <i>wing</i>, and it will all be gone within a little
while. I remember I have read of a famous man,
who having a <i>Clock-watch</i> long lying by him, out
of Kilture in his Trunk, it unaccountably struck
Eleven just before he died. Why, there are
many of you, for whom I am to do that office
this day: I am to tell you <i>You are come to your</i>
Eleventh <i>hour;</i> there is no more than a <i>twelfth
part</i> at most, of your life yet behind. But if we
neglect our business, till our <i>short Time</i> shall be
reduced into <i>none</i>, then, <i>woe to us, for the great
wrath of God will send us down from whence there is
no Redemption</i>.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Corollary IV.</i></p>

<p>How welcome should a <i>Death in the Lord</i> be unto
them that belong not unto the Devil, but unto the
Lord! While we are sojourning in this World, we
are in what may upon too many accounts be called
<i>The Devils Country:</i> We are where the Devil may
come upon us in <i>great wrath</i> continually. The
day when God shall take us out of this World,
will be, <i>The day when the Lord will deliver us from
the hand of all our Enemies, and from the hand of
Satan</i>. In such a day, why should not our song
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>be that of the Psalmist, <i>Blessed be my Rock, and let
the God of my Salvation be exalted!</i> While we
are here, we are in <i>the valley of the shadow of
death;</i> and what is it that makes it so? 'Tis because
the <i>wild Beasts of Hell</i> are lurking on every
side of us, and every minute ready to salley forth
upon us. But our <i>Death</i> will fetch us out of that
<i>Valley</i>, and carry us where we shall be <i>for ever
with the Lord</i>. We are now under the daily
<i>Buffetings</i> of the Devil, and he does molest us with
such <i>Fiery Darts</i>, as cause us even to cry out,
<i>I am weary of my Life</i>. Yea, but are we as
<i>willing to die, as, weary of Life?</i> Our Death will
then soon set us where we cannot be reach'd by
the <i>Fist of Wickedness;</i> and where the <i>Perfect
cannot be shotten at</i>. It is said in <i>Rev.</i> 14. 13.
<i>Blessed are the [34] Dead which die in the Lord,
they rest from their labours.</i> But we may say,
<i>Blessed are the Dead in the Lord, inasmuch as they
rest from the Devils!</i> Our <i>dying</i> will be but our
<i>taking wing:</i> When attended with a Convoy of
winged Angels, we shall be convey'd into that
Heaven, from whence the Devil having been
thrown he shall never more come thither after us.
What if God should now say to us, as to <i>Moses</i>,
<i>Go up and die!</i> As long as we <i>go up</i>, when we
<i>die</i>, let us receive the Message with a joyful Soul;
we shall soon be there, where the Devil can't <i>come
down</i> upon us. If the <i>God of our Life</i> should now
send that Order to us, which he gave to <i>Hezekiah</i>,
<i>Set thy house in order, for thou shalt die, and not</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
<i>live;</i> we need not be cast into such deadly Agonies
thereupon, as <i>Hezekiah</i> was: We are but going to
that <i>House</i>, the Golden Doors whereof, cannot be
entred by the Devil that here did use to persecute
us. Methinks I see the Departed <i>Spirit</i> of a Believer,
triumphantly carried thro' the Devils <i>Territories</i>,
in such a stately and Fiery Chariot, as the
<i>Spiritualizing Body</i> of <i>Elias</i> had; methink I see
the Devil, with whole Flocks of <i>Harpies</i>, grinning
at this Child of God, but unable to fasten any of
their griping Talons upon him: And then, upon
the utmost edge of our <i>Atmosphœre</i>, methinks I
overhear the holy Soul, with a most heavenly
Gallantry, deriding the defeated Fiend, and saying,
<i>Ah! Satan! Return to thy Dungeons again; I am
going where thou canst not come for ever!</i> O 'tis a
brave thing so to die! and especially so to die, in
<i>our time</i>. For, tho' when we call to mind, <i>That
the Devils time is now but short</i>, it may almost make
us wish to <i>live</i> unto the <i>end</i> of it; and to say with
the Psalmist, <i>Because the Lord will shortly appear
in his Glory to build up</i> Zion. <i>O my God! Take
me not away in the midst of my days.</i> Yet when we
bear in mind, <i>that the Devils Wrath is now most
great</i>, it would make one willing to be <i>out of the
way</i>. Inasmuch as now is the time for the doing
of those things in the prospect whereof <i>Balaam</i>
long ago cry'd out <i>Who shall live when such things
are done!</i> We should not be inordinatly loth to
<i>die</i> at such a time. In a word, the <i>Times</i> are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
<i>bad</i>, that we may well count it, as <i>good</i> a <i>time</i> to
die in, as ever we saw.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Corollary V.</i></p>

<p>Good News for the <i>Israel</i> of God, and particularly
for his <i>New-English Israel</i>. If the Devils
<i>Time</i> were above a <i>thousand years ago</i>, pronounced
<i>short</i>, what may we suppose it now in <i>our</i> Time?
Surely <i>we</i> are not a <i>thousand years</i> distant from
those happy <i>thousand years</i> of rest and peace, and
[which is better] <i>Holiness</i> reserved for the People
of God in the latter days; and if we are not a
<i>thousand years</i> yet short of that Golden Age, there
is cause to think, that we are not an <i>hundred</i>. That
the blessed <i>Thousand years</i> are not yet begun, is
abundantly clear [35] from this, <i>We do not see the
Devil bound;</i> No, the Devil was never more let
<i>loose</i> than in our Days; and it is very much that
any should imagine otherwise: But the same
thing that proves the <i>Thousand Years</i> of prosperity
for the Church of God, under the whole Heaven,
to be not yet <i>begun</i>, does also prove, that it is not
very <i>far off;</i> and that is the prodigious <i>wrath</i> with
which the Devil does in our days Persecute, yea,
desolate the World. Let us cast our Eyes almost
where we will, and we shall see the <i>Devils</i> domineering
at such a rate as may justly fill us with
astonishment; it is questionable whether <i>Iniquity</i>
ever were so rampant, or whether <i>Calamity</i> were
ever so pungent, as in this Lamentable <i>time;</i> We
may truly say, <i>'Tis the Hour and the Power of</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
<i>Darkness</i>. But, tho' the <i>wrath</i> be so <i>great</i>, the
<i>time</i> is but <i>short:</i> when we are perplexed with the
<i>wrath</i> of the Devil, the <i>Word</i> of our God at the
same time unto us, is that in Rom. 16. 20. <i>The
God of Peace shall bruise Satan under your feet
Shortly.</i> Shortly, didst thou say, dearest Lord!
O gladsome word! Amen, <i>Even so, come Lord!
Lord Jesus, come quickly! We shall never be rid of
this troublesome Devil, till thou do come to Chain
him up!</i></p>

<p>But because the people of God, would willingly
be told <i>whereabouts</i> we are, with reference to the
<i>wrath and the time</i> of the Devil, you shall give me
leave humbly to set before you a few <i>Conjectures</i>.</p>


<p class="center p2"><i>The first Conjecture.</i></p>

<p>The Devils <i>Eldest Son</i> seems to be towards the
<i>End</i> of his last <i>Half-time;</i> and if it be so, the
Devils Whole-time, cannot but be very near its
<i>End</i>. It is a very scandalous thing that any <i>Protestant</i>,
should be at a loss where to find <i>the Anti-Christ</i>.
But, we have a sufficient assurance, that
the Duration of <i>Anti-Christ</i>, is to be but for a
<i>Time</i>, and for <i>Times</i>, and for <i>Half a time;</i> that is
for <i>Twelve Hundred and Sixty Years</i>. And indeed,
those <i>Twelve Hundred and Sixty Years</i>, were the
very Spott of <i>Time</i> left for the <i>Devil</i>, and meant
when 'tis here said, <i>He has but a short time</i>. Now,
I should have an <i>easie time</i> of it, if I were never
put upon an <i>Harder Task</i>, than to produce what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
might render it extreamly probable, that Anti-christ
entred his last <i>Half-time</i>, or the last <i>Hundred</i>
and <i>Fourscore</i> years of his Reign, <i>at</i> or soon
<i>after</i> the celebrated <i>Reformation</i> which began at
the year 1517 in the former Century.<a name="FNanchor_102_101" id="FNanchor_102_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_101" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Indeed,
it is very agreeable to see how Antichrist then lost
<i>Half</i> of his Empire; and how that <i>half</i> which
then became <i>Reformed</i>, have been upon many
accounts little more than <i>Half-reformed</i>. But by
this computation, we must needs be within a very
few years of such a <i>Mortification</i> to befal the See
of <i>Rome</i>, as that Antichrist, who has lately been
planting (what proves no more lasting than) a
<i>Tabernacle in the Glorious Holy Mountain between
the Seas</i>, must quickly, <i>Come to his End and none
shall help him</i>. [36] So then, within a very little
while, we shall see the Devil stript of the grand,
yea, the last, <i>Vehicle</i>, wherein he will be capable
to abuse our World. The <i>Fires</i>, with which,
<i>That Beast</i> is to be consumed, will so singe the
Wings of the <i>Devil</i> too, that he shall no more set
the Affairs of <i>this</i> world on <i>Fire</i>. Yea, they shall
both go into the same <i>Fire</i>, to be <i>tormented for
ever and ever</i>.</p>


<p class="center p2"><i>The Second Conjecture.</i></p>

<p>That which is, perhaps, the greatest Effect of
the <i>Devils Wrath</i>, seems to be in a manner at an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span><i>end:</i> and this would make one hope that the
<i>Devils time</i> cannot be far from its <i>end</i>. It is in
Persecution, that the <i>wrath</i> of the Devil uses to
break forth, with its greatest fury. Now there
want not probabilities, that the <i>last Persecution</i>
intended for the Church of God, before the Advent
of our Lord, has been upon it. When we
see the <i>second Woe passing away</i>, we have a fair
signal given unto us, <i>That the last slaughter of our
Lord's Witnesses is over;</i> and then what Quickly
follows? The next thing is, <i>The Kingdoms of this
World, are become the Kingdoms of Our Lord, and
of His Christ:</i> and then <i>down</i> goes the Kingdom
of the Devil, so that he cannot any more <i>come
down</i> upon us. Now, the Irrecoverable and Irretrievable
Humiliations that have lately befallen
the <i>Turkish Power</i>, are but so many Declarations
of the <i>second Woe passing away</i>.<a name="FNanchor_103_102" id="FNanchor_103_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_102" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> And the dealings
of God with the <i>European</i> parts of the world, at this
day do further strengthen this our expectation. We
<i>do</i> see, <i>at this hour a great Earth-quake all Europe
over:</i> and <i>we shall</i> see, that this <i>great Earth-quake</i>,
and these great Commotions, will but contribute
unto the advancement of our Lords hitherto depressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
Interests. 'Tis also to be remark'd that,
a disposition to recognize the <i>Empire</i> of God over
the <i>Conscience</i> of man, does now prevail more in
the world than formerly; and God from on High
more touches the Hearts of Princes and Rulers
with an averseness to Persecution. 'Tis particularly
the unspeakable happiness of the English
Nation, to be under the Influences of that excellent
Queen, who could say, <i>In as much as a man
cannot make himself believe what he will, why
should we Persecute men for not believing as we do!
I wish I could see all good men of one mind; but in
the mean time I pray, let them however love one
another.</i><a name="FNanchor_104_103" id="FNanchor_104_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_103" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Words worthy to be written in Letters
of Gold! and by <i>us</i> the more to be considered,
because to one of <i>Ours</i> did that royal Person express
Her self so excellently, so obligingly. When
the late King <i>James</i> published his Declaration for
<i>Liberty of Conscience</i>, a worthy Divine in the
Church of <i>England</i>, then studying the <i>Revelation</i>,
saw cause upon <i>Revelational</i> Grounds, to declare
himself in such words as these, <i>Whatsoever others
may intend or design by this Liberty of Conscience, I
cannot believe, that it will ever be recalled in</i> England,
<i>as long as the World stands</i>. And you know
how miraculously [37] the <i>Earth-quake</i><a name="FNanchor_105_104" id="FNanchor_105_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_104" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> which
then immediately came upon the Kingdom, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>established that <i>Liberty!</i> But that which exceeds
all the tendencies this way, is, the dispensation of
God at this Day, towards the blessed <i>Vaudois</i>.
Those renowned <i>Waldenses</i>, which were a sort of
<i>Root</i> unto all Protestant Churches, were never
dissipated, by all the Persecutions of many Ages,
till within these few years, the <i>French</i> King and
the Duke of <i>Savoy</i> leagued for their dissipation.<a name="FNanchor_106_105" id="FNanchor_106_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_105" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
But just <i>Three years and a half after the scattering</i>
of that holy people, to the surprise of all the
World, <i>Spirit of life from God</i> is come into them;
and having with a thousand Miracles repossessed
themselves of their antient Seats, their hot <i>Persecutor</i>
is become their great <i>Protector</i>. Whereupon
the reflection of the worthy person, that writes
the story is, <i>The Churches of</i> Piemont, <i>being the
Root of the Protestant Churches, they have been the
first established; the Churches of other places, being
but the Branches, shall be established in due time,
God will deliver them speedily, He has already delivered
the Mother, and He will not long leave the
Daughter behind: He will finish what he has gloriously
begun!</i></p>


<p class="center p2"><i>The Third Conjecture.</i></p>

<p>There is <i>little room</i> for hope, that the <i>great
wrath</i> of the Devil, will not prove the present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>ruine of our poor <i>New-England</i> in particular. I
believe, there never was a poor Plantation, more
pursued by the <i>wrath</i> of the <i>Devil</i>, than our poor
<i>New-England;</i> and that which makes our condition
very much the more deplorable is, that
the <i>wrath</i> of the <i>great God</i> Himself, at the same
time also presses hard upon us. It was a rousing
<i>alarm</i> to the Devil, when a great Company of
English <i>Protestants</i> and <i>Puritans</i>, came to erect
Evangelical Churches, in a corner of the World,
where he had reign'd without any controul for
many Ages; and it is a vexing <i>Eye-sore</i> to the
Devil, that our Lord Christ should be known,
and own'd and preached in this <i>howling Wilderness</i>.
Wherefor he has left no <i>Stone unturned</i>,
that so he might undermine his Plantation, and
force us out of our Country.</p>

<p>First, The Indian <i>Powawes</i>, used all their Sorceries
to molest the first Planters here;<a name="FNanchor_107_106" id="FNanchor_107_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_106" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> but
God said unto them, <i>Touch them not!</i> Then, <i>Seducing
Spirits</i> came to <i>root</i> in this Vineyard, but
God so rated them off, that they have not prevail'd
much farther than the Edges of our Land.<a name="FNanchor_108_107" id="FNanchor_108_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_107" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
After this, we have had a continual <i>blast</i> upon
some of our principal Grain, annually diminishing
a vast part of our <i>ordinary Food</i>. Herewithal,
wasting <i>Sicknesses</i>, especially Burning and Mortal
Agues, have Shot the Arrows of Death in at our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>Windows. Next, we have had many Adversaries
of our own Language, who have been perpetually
assaying to deprive us of those <i>English
Liberties</i>, in the encouragement whereof these
Territories have been settled.<a name="FNanchor_109_108" id="FNanchor_109_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_108" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> As if this had
not been [38] enough; The <i>Tawnies</i> among whom
we came, have watered our Soil with the Blood
of many Hundreds of our Inhabitants. Desolating
<i>Fires</i> also have many times laid the chief
Treasure of the whole Province in Ashes. As
for <i>Losses</i> by Sea, <i>they</i> have been multiply'd upon
us: and particularly in the present <i>French War</i>,
the whole English Nation have observ'd that no
part of the Nation has proportionably had so
many Vessels taken, as our poor <i>New-England</i>.
Besides all which, now at last the Devils are (if I
may so speak) <i>in Person</i> come down upon us with
such a <i>Wrath</i>, as is justly <i>much</i>, and will quickly be
<i>more</i>, the Astonishment of the World. Alas, I may
sigh over <i>this</i> Wilderness, as <i>Moses</i> did over <i>his</i>,
in Psal. 90. 7. 9. <i>We are consumed by thine Anger,
and by thy Wrath we are troubled: All our days
are passed away in thy Wrath.</i> And I may add
this unto it, <i>The Wrath of the Devil too has been
troubling and spending of us, all our days</i>.</p>

<p>But what will become of this poor <i>New-England</i>
after all? Shall we sink, expire, perish,
before the <i>short time</i> of the Devil shall be finished?<a name="FNanchor_110_109" id="FNanchor_110_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_109" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
I must confess, That when I consider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>the lamentable <i>Unfruitfulness</i> of men, among us,
under as powerful and perspicuous Dispensations
of the Gospel, as are in the World; and when
I consider the declining state of the <i>Power of
Godliness</i> in our Churches, with the most horrible
Indisposition that perhaps ever was, to recover
out of this declension; I cannot but <i>Fear</i> lest it
comes to this, and lest an <i>Asiatic</i> Removal of
Candlesticks come upon us. But upon some
other Accounts, I would fain <i>hope</i> otherwise; and
I will give <i>you</i> therefore the opportunity to try
what Inferences may be drawn from these probable
Prognostications.</p>

<p>I say, <i>First</i>, That surely, <i>America's</i> Fate must
at the long run include <i>New-Englands</i> in it.
What was the design of our God, in bringing
over so many <i>Europeans</i> hither of late Years? Of
what use or state will <i>America</i> be, when the
<i>Kingdom of God</i> shall come? If it must all be
the Devils propriety, while the <i>saved Nations</i> of
the other Hæmisphere shall be <i>Walking in the
Light of the New Jerusalem</i>, Our <i>New-England</i>
has then, 'tis likely, done all that it was erected
for. But if God have a purpose to make here a
seat for any of <i>those glorious things which are spoken
of thee, O thou City of God;</i> then even thou, <i>O
New-England</i>, art within a very little while of
better days than ever yet have dawn'd upon thee.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>
<p>I say, <i>Secondly</i>, That tho' there be very <i>Threatning</i>
Symptoms on <i>America</i>, yet there are some
<i>hopeful</i> ones. I confess, when one thinks upon
the crying Barbarities with which the most of
those <i>Europeans</i> that have Peopled this New
world, became the Masters of it; it looks but
<i>Ominously</i>. When one also thinks how much the
way of living in many parts of <i>America</i>, is utterly
inconsistent with the very Essentials of <i>Christianity;</i>
yea, how much Injury and Violence is there[39]in
done to <i>Humanity</i> it self; it is enough to
damp the Hopes of the most Sanguine Complexion.
And the <i>Frown</i> of Heaven which has
hitherto been upon Attempts of better Gospellizing
the Plantations, considered, will but increase
the <i>Damp</i>. Nevertheless, on the other side, what
shall be said of all the <i>Promises</i>, That <i>our Lord
Jesus Christ shall have the uttermost parts of the
Earth for his Possession?</i> and of all the <i>Prophecies</i>,
That <i>All the ends of the Earth shall remember and
turn unto the Lord?</i> Or does it look <i>agreeably</i>,
That such a rich quarter of the World, equal in
some regards to all the rest, should never be out
of the <i>Devils</i> hands, from the first Inhabitation
unto the last Dissolution of it? No sure; why
may not the <i>last</i> be the <i>first?</i> and the <i>Sun of
Righteousness</i> come to shine <i>brightest</i>, in Climates
which it rose <i>latest</i> upon!</p>

<p>I say, <i>Thirdly</i>, That <i>as</i> it fares with <i>Old England</i>,
so it will be most likely to fare with <i>New-England</i>.
For which cause, by the way, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
may be more of the Divine Favour in the present
Circumstances of our dependence on <i>England</i>,
than we are well aware of. This is very sure, if
matters <i>go ill</i> with our <i>Mother</i>, her poor American
<i>Daughter</i> here, must feel it; nor could our
former Happy Settlement have hindred our sympathy
in that Unhappiness. But if matters <i>go
Well</i> in the Three Kingdoms; as long as God
shall bless the English Nation, with Rulers that
shall encourage <i>Piety</i>, <i>Honesty</i>, <i>Industry</i>, in their
Subjects, and that shall cast a Benign Aspect upon
the Interests of our Glorious Gospel, <i>Abroad</i> as
well as at <i>Home;</i> so long, <i>New-England</i> will at
least keep its head above water: and so much
the more, for our comfortable Settlement in
such a Form as we are now cast into. Unless
there should be any singular, destroying, <i>Topical
Plagues</i>, whereby an offended God should at last
make us <i>Rise;</i> But, <i>Alas, O Lord, what other
Hive hast thou provided for us!</i></p>

<p>I say, <i>Fourthly</i>, That the <i>Elder England</i> will
certainly and speedily be Visited with the <i>ancient
loving kindness</i> of God. When one sees, how
strangely the Curse of our <i>Joshua</i>, has fallen upon
the Persons and Houses of them that have attempted
the Rebuilding of the <i>Old</i> Romish
<i>Jericho</i>, which has there been so far demolished,
they cannot but say, That the <i>Reformation</i> there,
shall not only be maintained, but also pursued,
proceeded, perfected; and that God will shortly
there have a <i>New Jerusalem</i>. Or, Let a Man in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
his thoughts run over but the series of amazing
Providences towards the English Nation for the
last <i>Thirty Years:</i> Let him reflect, how many
Plots for the ruine of the Nation have been
strangely discovered? yea, how very unaccountably
those very <i>Persons</i>, yea, I may also say, and
those very <i>Methods</i> which were intended for the
tools of that ruine, have become the instruments
or occasions of Deliverances? A man cannot
but say upon these Reflec[40]tions, as the Wife
of <i>Manoah</i> once prudently expressed her self, <i>If
the Lord were pleased to have Destroyed us, He would
not have shew'd us all these things</i>. Indeed, It is
not unlikely, that the Enemies of the English
Nation, may yet provoke such a <i>Shake</i> unto it, as
may perhaps exceed any that has hitherto been
undergone: the Lord prevent the Machinations
of his Adversaries! But that <i>shake</i> will usher in
the most <i>glorious Times</i> that ever arose upon the
English <i>Horizon</i>. As for the <i>French</i> Cloud which
hangs over <i>England</i>, tho' it be like to Rain showers
of <i>Blood</i> upon a Nation, where the <i>Blood</i> of the
Blessed Jesus has been too much treated as an
<i>Unholy Thing;</i> yet I believe God will shortly
scatter it: and my belief is grounded upon a bottom
that will bear it. If that overgrown <i>French
Leviathan</i><a name="FNanchor_111_110" id="FNanchor_111_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_110" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> should accomplish any thing like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>Conquest of <i>England</i>, what could there be to
hinder him from the Universal Empire of the
<i>West?</i> But the <i>Visions</i> of the Western World, in
the <i>Views</i> both of <i>Daniel</i> and of <i>John</i>, do assure
us, that whatever Monarch, shall while the <i>Papacy</i>
continues go to swallow up the <i>Ten Kings</i> which
received <i>their Power</i> upon the Fall of the Western
Empire, he must miscarry in the Attempt.
The <i>French Phaetons</i> Epitaph seems written in
that, <i>Sure Word of Prophecy</i>.</p>

<p>[Since the making of this Conjecture, there
are arriv'd unto us, the News of a Victory obtain'd
by the <i>English</i> over the <i>French</i>, which further
confirms our Conjecture; and causes us to sing,
<i>Pharaohs Chariots, and his Hosts, has the Lord cast
down into the Sea; Thy right-hand has dashed in
pieces the Enemy!</i>]<a name="FNanchor_112_111" id="FNanchor_112_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_111" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Now, <i>In the Salvation</i> of England, the Plantations
cannot but <i>Rejoyce</i>, and <i>New-England</i> also
will <i>be Glad</i>.</p>

<p>But so much for our <i>Corollaries</i>, I hasten to
the main thing designed for your entertainment.
And that is,</p>

Miles from the Earth.
Now, allowing Lucifer to be able
to fly with the Velocity of Sound,
he could not reach this Planet
short of 50,000 Years! Hence he
must have set out on his Journey
thousands of Years before the World
was created. But the Arabians believe
that Mahomet performed that

Work entitled <i>England's Warning
Pieces</i>, printed in 1642, and fully
illustrated by Engravings. Among
<i>Prodigies</i> related, the Writer says:
"I remember our Brethren in New
England, not long since, made use
of another most prodigious and
mishapen and monstrous Birth,
brought foorth by a Gentlewoman
of that New Plantation, who had
beene a maine Fautrix, if not
originall Broacher of very many
most wicked, dangerous and damnable
Opinions in their Church."

50,000 Protestants were forced to

AN HORTATORY AND NECESSARY ADDRESS,<br />
TO A COUNTRY NOW EXTRAORDINARILY<br />
ALARUM'D<br />
BY THE WRATH OF THE<br />
DEVIL. <i>TIS THIS</i>, </h3>

<p class="dropcap">LET us now make a good and a right use of
the prodigious <i>descent</i> which the <i>Devil</i> in
<i>Great Wrath</i> is at this day making upon
our Land. Upon the Death of a Great Man
once, an Orator call'd the Town together, crying
out, <i>Concurrite Cives, Dilapsa sunt vestra Mœnia!</i>
that is, <i>Come together, Neighbours, your Town-Walls
are fallen down!</i> But such is the descent
of the Devil at this day upon our selves, that I
may truly tell you, <i>The Walls of the whole World
are broken down!</i> The usual <i>Walls</i> of defence
about mankind have such a Gap made in them,
that the very <i>Devils</i> are broke in upon us, to seduce
the <i>Souls</i>, torment the <i>Bodies</i>, sully the
<i>Credits</i>, and consume the <i>Estates</i> of our Neighbours,
[41] with Impressions both as <i>real</i> and as
<i>furious</i>, as if the <i>Invisible</i> World were becoming
<i>Incarnate</i>, on purpose for the vexing of us. And
what use ought now to be made of so tremendous
a dispensation? We are engaged in a <i>Fast</i> this
day;<a name="FNanchor_113_112" id="FNanchor_113_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_112" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> but shall we try to fetch <i>Meat out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>Eater</i>, and make the <i>Lion</i> to afford some <i>Hony</i>
for our <i>Souls?</i></p>

<p>That the Devil is <i>come down unto us with great
Wrath</i>, we find, we feel, we now deplore.<a name="FNanchor_114_113" id="FNanchor_114_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_113" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> In
many ways, for many years hath the Devil been
assaying to Extirpate the Kingdom of our Lord
Jesus here. <i>New-England</i> may complain of the
Devil, as in Psal. 129. 1, 2. <i>Many a time have they
afflicted me, from my Youth, may</i> New-England
<i>now say; many a time have they afflicted me from my
Youth; yet they have not prevailed against me.</i>
But now there is a more than ordinary <i>affliction</i>,
with which the <i>Devil</i> is Galling of us: and such
an one as is indeed Unparallelable. The things
confessed by <i>Witches</i>, and the things endured by
<i>Others</i>, laid together, amount unto this account of
our Affliction. The <i>Devil</i>, Exhibiting himself
ordinarily as a small <i>Black man</i>, has decoy'd a
fearful knot of proud, froward, ignorant, envious
and malicious creatures, to lift themselves in his
horrid Service, by entring their Names in a <i>Book</i>
by him tendred unto them.<a name="FNanchor_115_114" id="FNanchor_115_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_114" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> These <i>Witches</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>whereof above a Score have now <i>Confessed and
shown their Deeds</i>, and some are now tormented
by the Devils, for <i>Confessing</i>, have met in Hellish
<i>Randezvouzes</i>, wherein the Confessors do say, they
have had their diabolical Sacraments, imitating
the <i>Baptism</i> and the <i>Supper</i> of our Lord. In
these hellish meetings, these Monsters have associated
themselves to do no less a thing than, <i>To
destroy the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, in
these parts of the World;</i> and in order hereunto,
First they each of them have their <i>Spectres</i>, or
Devils, commission'd by them, &amp; representing of
them, to be the Engines of their Malice. By
these wicked <i>Spectres</i>, they seize poor people
about the Country, with various &amp; bloudy <i>Torments;</i>
and of those evidently Preternatural torments
there are some have dy'd. They have
bewitched some, even so far as to make <i>Self-destroyers:</i><a name="FNanchor_116_115" id="FNanchor_116_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_115" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
and others are in many Towns here
and there languishing under their <i>Evil hands</i>.
The people thus afflicted, are miserably scratched
and bitten, so that the Marks are most visible to
all the World, but the causes utterly invisible; and
the same Invisible Furies do most visibly stick Pins
into the bodies of the afflicted, and <i>scald</i> them,
and hideously distort, and disjoint all their members,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
besides a thousand other sorts of Plagues
beyond these of any natural diseases which they
give unto them. Yea, they sometimes drag the
poor people out of their chambers, and carry them
over Trees and Hills, for divers miles together.
A large part of the persons tortured by these Diabolical
<i>Spectres</i>, are horribly tempted by them,
sometimes with fair [42] promises, and sometimes
with hard threatnings, but always with felt miseries,
to sign the <i>Devils Laws</i> in a Spectral Book
laid before them; which two or three of these
poor Sufferers, being by their tiresome sufferings
overcome to do, they have immediately been released
from all their miseries and they appear'd in
<i>Spectre</i> then to Torture those that were before their
Fellow-Sufferers. The <i>Witches</i> which by their
covenant with the Devil, are become Owners of
<i>Spectres</i>, are oftentimes by their own <i>Spectres</i> required
and compelled to give their consent, for
the molestation of some, which they had no mind
otherwise to fall upon; and cruel Depredations
are then made upon the Vicinage. In the Prosecution
of these Witchcrafts, among a thousand
other unaccountable things, the <i>Spectres</i> have an
odd faculty of cloathing the most substantial and
corporeal Instruments of Torture, with Invisibility,
while the wounds thereby given have been the
most palpable things in the World; so that the
Sufferers assaulted with Instruments of Iron,
wholly unseen to the standers by, though, to their
cost, seen by themselves, have, upon snatching,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
wrested the Instruments out of the <i>Spectres</i> hands,
and every one has then immediately not only
<i>beheld</i>, but <i>handled</i>, an Iron Instrument taken by a
Devil from a Neighbour. These wicked <i>Spectres</i>
have proceeded so far, as to steal several quantities
of Mony from divers people, part of which
Money, has, before sufficient Spectators, been dropt
out of the Air into the Hands of the Sufferers,
while the <i>Spectres</i> have been urging them to subscribe
their <i>Covenant with Death</i>.<a name="FNanchor_117_116" id="FNanchor_117_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_116" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> In such extravagant
ways have these Wretches propounded,
the <i>Dragooning</i> of as many as they can, in their
own Combination, and the <i>Destroying</i> of others,
with lingring, spreading, deadly diseases; till our
Countrey should at last become too hot for us.
Among the Ghastly Instances of the <i>success</i> which
those Bloody Witches have had, we have seen even
some of their own Children, so dedicated unto the
Devil, that in their Infancy, it is found, the <i>Imps</i>
have sucked them, and rendred them Venemous
to a Prodigy. We have also seen the Devils first
batteries upon the Town, where the first Church
of our Lord in this Colony was gathered, producing
those distractions, which have almost ruin'd
the Town.<a name="FNanchor_118_117" id="FNanchor_118_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_117" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> We have seen likewise the <i>Plague</i>
reaching afterwards into other Towns far and near,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>where the Houses of good Men have the Devils
filling of them with terrible Vexations!</p>

<p>This is the Descent, which, it seems, the Devil
has now made upon us. But that which makes
this Descent the more formidable, is; the <i>multitude</i>
and <i>quality</i> of Persons accused of an interest
in this <i>Witchcraft</i>, by the Efficacy of the <i>Spectres</i>
which take their Name and shape upon them;
causing very many good and wise Men to fear,
[43] That many <i>innocent</i>, yea, and some <i>vertuous</i>
persons, are by the Devils in this matter, imposed
upon; That the Devils have obtain'd the power,
to take on them the likeness of harmless people,
and in that likeness afflict other people, and be so
abused by Præstigious <i>Dæmons</i>, that upon their
look or touch, the afflicted shall be oddly affected.
Arguments from the <i>Providence of God</i>, on the
one side, and from our <i>Charity</i> towards <i>Man</i> on
the other side, have made this now to become a
most agitated Controversie among us. There is
an <i>Agony</i> produced in the Minds of Men, lest the
Devil should sham us with <i>Devices</i>, of perhaps a
finer Thred, than was ever yet practised upon the
World. The whole business is become hereupon
so <i>Snarled</i>, and the determination of the Question
one way or another, so <i>dismal</i>, that our Honourable
Judges have a Room for <i>Jehoshaphat's</i> Exclamation,
<i>We know not what to do!</i><a name="FNanchor_119_118" id="FNanchor_119_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_118" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> They have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>used, as Judges have heretofore done, the <i>Spectral
Evidences</i>, to introduce their further Enquiries
into the <i>Lives</i> of the persons accused; and they
have thereupon, by the wonderful Providence of
God, been so strengthened with <i>other evidences</i>,
that some of the <i>Witch Gang</i> have been fairly
Executed. But what shall be done, as to those
against whom the <i>evidence</i> is chiefly founded in
the <i>dark world?</i> Here they do solemnly demand
our Addresses to the <i>Father of Lights</i>, on their
behalf. But in the mean time, the Devil improves
the <i>Darkness</i> of this Affair, to push us into
a <i>Blind Mans Buffet</i>, and we are even ready to be
<i>sinfully</i>, yea, hotly, and madly, mauling one another
in the <i>dark</i>.<a name="FNanchor_120_119" id="FNanchor_120_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_119" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>The consequence of these things, every <i>considerate</i>
Man trembles at; and the more, because
the frequent cheats of Passion, and Rumour, do
precipitate so many, that I wish I could say, The
most were <i>considerate</i>.</p>

<p>But that which carries on the formidableness
of our Trials, unto that which may be called, <i>A
wrath unto the uttermost</i>, is this: It is not without
the <i>wrath</i> of the Almighty <i>God</i> himself, that the
<i>Devil</i> is permitted thus to come down upon us in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span><i>wrath</i>. It was said, in <i>Isa.</i> 9. 19. <i>Through the
wrath of the Lord of Hosts, the Land is darkned.</i>
Our Land is <i>darkned</i> indeed; since the <i>Powers of
Darkness</i> are turned in upon us: 'tis a <i>dark time</i>,
yea a black night indeed, now the <i>Ty-dogs</i><a name="FNanchor_121_120" id="FNanchor_121_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_120" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> of
the Pit are abroad among us: but, <i>It is through the
wrath of the Lord of Hosts!</i> Inasmuch as the <i>Fire-brands
of Hell</i> it self are used for the scorching of
us, with cause enough may we cry out, <i>What means
the heat of this Anger?</i> Blessed Lord! Are all the
other Instruments of thy Vengeance, too good for
the chastisement of such transgressors as we are?
Must the very <i>Devils</i> be sent out of <i>Their own
place</i>, to be our Troublers: Must we be lash'd
with <i>Scorpions</i>, fetch'd from the <i>Place of [44]
Torment?</i> Must this <i>Wilderness</i> be made a Receptacle
for the <i>Dragons of the Wilderness?</i> If a <i>Lapland</i>
should nourish in it vast numbers, the successors
of the old <i>Biarmi</i>,<a name="FNanchor_122_121" id="FNanchor_122_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_121" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> who can with looks
or words bewitch other people, or sell Winds to
Mariners, and have their <i>Familiar Spirits</i> which
they bequeath to their Children when they die,
and by their Enchanted Kettle-Drums can learn
things done a Thousand Leagues off; If a <i>Swedeland</i>
should afford a Village, where some scores of
Haggs, may not only have their Meetings with
<i>Familiar Spirits</i>, but also by their Enchantments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>drag many scores of poor children out of their
Bed-chambers, to be spoiled at those Meetings;
This, were not altogether a matter of so much
wonder! But that <i>New-England</i> should this way
be harrassed! They are not <i>Chaldeans</i>, that <i>Bitter
and Hasty Nation</i>, but they are, <i>Bitter and Burning
Devils;</i> They are not <i>Swarthy Indians</i>, but they
are <i>Sooty Devils;</i> that are let loose upon us. Ah,
Poor <i>New-England!</i> Must the plague of <i>Old
Ægypt</i> come upon thee? Whereof we read in
<i>Psal.</i> 78. 49. <i>He cast upon them the fierceness of
his Anger, Wrath, and Indignation, and Trouble, by
sending Evil Angels among them</i>. What, O what
must next be looked for? Must that which is
there next mentioned, be next encountered? <i>He
spared not their soul from death, but gave their life
over to the Pestilence.</i> For my part, when I consider
what <i>Melancthon</i> says, in one of his Epistles,
<i>That these Diabolical Spectacles are often Prodigies;</i>
and when I consider, how often people have been
by <i>Spectres</i> called upon, just before their Deaths;
I am verily afraid, lest some wasting <i>Mortality</i> be
among the things, which this Plague is the <i>Fore-runner</i>
of. I pray God prevent it!</p>

<p>But now, <i>What shall we do?</i></p>

<p><i>I.</i> Let the Devils <i>coming down</i> in <i>great wrath</i>
upon us, cause us to <i>come down</i> in <i>great grief</i> before
the Lord. We may truly and sadly say, <i>We
are brought very low! Low</i> indeed, when the
Serpents of the dust, are crawling and coyling
about us, and Insulting over us. May we not say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
<i>We are in the very Belly of Hell</i>, when <i>Hell</i> it self
is feeding upon us? But how <i>Low</i> is that! O let
us then most penitently lay our selves very <i>Low</i> before
the God of Heaven, who has thus Abased
us.<a name="FNanchor_123_122" id="FNanchor_123_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_122" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> When a Truculent <i>Nero</i> a <i>Devil</i> of a Man,
was turned in upon the World, it was said, in 1
Pet. 5. 6. <i>Humble your selves under the mighty hand
of God</i>. How much more now ought we to <i>humble
our selves</i> under that <i>Mighty Hand</i> of that God
who indeed has the <i>Devil</i> in a <i>Chain</i>, but has
horribly lengthened on the <i>Chain!</i><a name="FNanchor_124_123" id="FNanchor_124_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_123" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> When the
old people of God heard any <i>Blasphemies</i>, tearing
of his Ever-Blessed Name to pieces, they were to
<i>Rend their Cloaths</i> at what they heard. I am
sure that we have cause to <i>Rend our Hearts</i> this
Day, when we see [45] what an High Treason
has been committed against the most high God,
by the Witchcrafts in our Neighbourhood. We
may say; and shall we not be <i>humbled</i> when we
say it? <i>We have seen an horrible thing done in our
Land!</i> O 'tis a most humbling thing, to think,
that ever there should be such an abomination
among us, as for a crue of humane race to renounce
their <i>Maker</i>, and to unite with the <i>Devil</i>,
for the troubling of mankind, and for People to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>be, (as is by some confess'd) <i>Baptized</i> by a <i>Fiend</i>
using this form upon them, <i>Thou art mine and I
have a full power over thee!</i> afterwards communicating
in an Hellish <i>Bread</i> and <i>Wine</i>, by that
Fiend administred unto them. It was said in
Deut. 18. 10, 11, 12. <i>There shall not be found
among you an Inchanter, or a Witch, or a Charmer,
or a Consulter with Familiar Spirits, or a Wizzard,
or a Necromancer; For all that do these things are
an Abomination to the Lord, and because of these
Abominations, the Lord thy God doth drive them out
before thee.</i> That <i>New-England</i> now should have
these <i>Abominations</i> in it, yea, that some of no mean
<i>Profession</i>, should be found guilty of them: Alas,
what <i>Humiliations</i> are we all hereby oblig'd unto?
O 'tis a <i>Defiled Land</i>, wherein we live; Let us be
humbled for these <i>Defiling Abominations</i>, lest we
be driven out of our Land. It's a very <i>humbling</i>
thing to think, what reproaches will be cast upon
us, for this matter, among <i>The Daughters of the
Philistines</i>. Indeed, enough might easily be said
for the vindication of <i>this</i> Country from the <i>Singularity</i>
of this matter, by ripping up, what has
been discovered in <i>others</i>. <i>Great Britain</i> alone,
and this also in our days of <i>Greatest Light</i>, has
had that in it, which may divert the Calumnies
of an ill-natured World, from centring here.
They are words of the Devout Bishop <i>Hall,</i><a name="FNanchor_125_124" id="FNanchor_125_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_124" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span><i>Satans prevalency in this Age, is most clear in the
marvellous Number of Witches abounding in all
places. Now Hundreds are discovered in one Shire;
and, if Fame Deceives us not, in a Village of Fourteen
Houses in the North, are found so many of this
Damned Brood. Yea, and those of both Sexes, who
have Professed much Knowledge, Holiness, and Devotion,
are drawn into this Damnable Practice.</i> I
suppose the Doctor in the first of those Passages,
may refer to what happened in the Year 1645.
When so many Vassals of the Devil were Detected,
that there were <i>Thirty</i> try'd at one time,
whereas about <i>fourteen</i> were Hang'd, and an
Hundred more detained in the Prisons of <i>Suffolk</i>
and <i>Essex</i>. Among other things which many of
these Acknowledged, one was, That they were
to undergo certain <i>Punishments</i>, if they did not
such and such <i>Hurts</i>, as were appointed them.
And, among the rest that were then Executed,
there was an Old Parson, called <i>Lowis</i>, who confessed,
That he had a couple of <i>Imps</i>, whereof
<i>one</i> was always putting him upon the doing of
Mischief; Once particularly, that <i>Imp</i> calling for
his Consent so to do, went immediately and Sunk
a <i>Ship</i>, then under Sail.<a name="FNanchor_126_125" id="FNanchor_126_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_125" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> I pray, let not <i>New-England</i>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
become of an Unsavoury and a Sulphurous
Resentment in the Opinion of the World abroad,
for the Doleful things which are now fallen out
among us, while there are such <i>Histories</i> of other
places abroad in the World.<a name="FNanchor_127_126" id="FNanchor_127_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_126" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Nevertheless, I am
sure that <i>we</i>, the People of <i>New-England</i>, have
cause enough to <i>Humble</i> our selves under our most
<i>Humbling</i> Circumstances. We must no more be
<i>Haughty, because of the Lords Holy Mountain among
us;</i> No it becomes us rather to be, <i>Humble, because
we have been such an Habitation of Unholy
Devils!</i></p>

<p><i>II.</i> Since the Devil is <i>come down in great wrath</i>
upon us, let not us in our <i>great wrath</i> against one
another provide a <i>Lodging</i> for him. It was a most
wholesome caution, in <i>Eph.</i> 4. 26, 27. <i>Let not the
Sun go down upon your wrath: Neither give place
to the Devil.</i> The Devil is come down to see
what <i>Quarter</i> he shall find among us:<a name="FNanchor_128_127" id="FNanchor_128_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_127" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> And if
his coming down, do now fill us with <i>wrath</i>
against one another, and if between the cause of
the <i>Sufferers</i> on one hand, and the cause of the
<i>Suspected</i> on t'other, we carry things to such extreams
of <i>Passion</i> as are now gaining upon us, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>Devil will Bless himself, to find such a convenient
<i>Lodging</i> as we shall therein afford unto him.<a name="FNanchor_129_128" id="FNanchor_129_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_128" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
And it may be that the <i>wrath</i> which we have had
against one another has had more than a little influence
upon the coming down of the Devil in
that <i>wrath</i> which now amazes us. Have not
many of us been <i>Devils</i> one unto another for
Slanderings, for Backbitings, for Animosities?
For <i>this</i>, among other causes, perhaps, God has
permitted the Devils to be worrying, as they now
are, among us. But it is high time to leave off
all <i>Devilism</i>, when the <i>Devil</i> himself is falling
upon us: And it is <i>no time</i> for us to be Censuring
and Reviling one another, with a <i>Devilish wrath</i>,
when the <i>wrath</i> of the <i>Devil</i> is annoying of us.
The way for us to out-wit the Devil, in the <i>Wiles</i>
with which he now <i>Vexes</i> [46] us, would be for
us to joyn as one man in our cries to God, for the
Directing, and Issuing of this Thorny Business;
but if we do not <i>Lift up</i> our Hands to Heaven,
<i>without Wrath</i>, we cannot then do it <i>without
Doubt</i>, of speeding in it. I am ashamed when I
read French Authors giving this Character of
Englishmen [<i>Ils se haissent Les uns les autres, et
sont en Division Continuelle.</i>] <i>They hate one another,
and are always Quarelling one with another.</i><a name="FNanchor_130_129" id="FNanchor_130_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_129" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>I shall be much more ashamed, if it become the
Character of <i>New-Englanders;</i> which is indeed
what the Devil would have. <i>Satan</i> would make
us <i>bruise</i> one another, by breaking of the <i>Peace</i>
among us; but O let us disappoint him. We
read of a thing that sometimes happens to the
<i>Devil</i>, when he is foaming with his <i>Wrath</i>, in
Mat. 12. 43. <i>The unclean Spirit seeks rest, and
finds none.</i> But we give <i>rest</i> unto the Devil, by
<i>wrath</i> one against another. If we would lay
aside all fierceness, and keenness, in the disputes
which the Devil has raised among us; and if we
would use to one another none but the <i>soft
Answers, which turn away wrath:</i> I should hope
that we might light upon such Counsels, as would
quickly Extricate us out of our <i>Labyrinths</i>. But
the old <i>Incendiary</i> of the world, is come from
Hell, with <i>Sparks</i> of Hell-Fire flashing on every
side of him; and we make ourselves <i>Tynder</i> to the
Sparks. When the Emperour <i>Henry</i> III.<a name="FNanchor_131_130" id="FNanchor_131_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_130" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> kept
the Feast of <i>Pentecost</i>, at the City <i>Mentz</i>, there
arose a dissension among some of the people there,
which came from words to blows, and at last it
passed on to the shedding of Blood. After the
Tumult was over, when they came to that clause
in their Devotions, <i>Thou hast made this day Glorious;</i>
the Devil to the unexpressible Terrour of
that vast Assembly, made the Temple Ring with
that Outcry <i>But I have made this Day Quarrelsome!</i>
We are truly come into a day, which by being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>well managed might be very <i>Glorious</i>, for the exterminating
of those <i>Accursed things</i>, which have
hitherto been the Clogs of our Prosperity; but if
we make this day <i>Quarrelsome</i>, thro' any <i>Raging
Confidences</i>, Alas, <i>O Lord, my Flesh Trembles for
Fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments</i>.
<i>Erasmus</i>, among other Historians, tells us, that at
a Town in <i>Germany</i>, a Witch or Devil, appeared
on the Top of a Chimney, Threatning to set the
Town on <i>Fire:</i> And at length, Scattering a Pot
of Ashes abroad, the Town was presently and horribly
Burnt unto the Ground.<a name="FNanchor_132_131" id="FNanchor_132_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_131" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Methinks, I see
the <i>Spectres</i>, from the Top of the Chimneys to
the Northward, threatning to scatter <i>Fire</i>, about
the Countrey; but let us quench that <i>Fire</i>, by the
most amicable Correspondencies: Lest, as the
<i>Spectres</i>, have, they say, already most Literally
burnt some of our Dwellings there do come forth
a further <i>Fire</i> from the <i>Brambles</i> of Hell, which
may more terribly <i>Devour</i> us. Let us not be like
a <i>Troubled House</i>, altho' we are so much haunted
by the <i>Devils</i>. Let our <i>Long suffering</i> be a well-placed
piece of <i>Armour</i>, about us, against the
<i>Fiery Darts</i> of the wicked ones. History informs
us, That so long ago, as the year, 858, a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>Pestilent and Malignant sort of <i>Dæmon</i>, molested
<i>Caumont</i> in <i>Germany</i> with all sorts of methods to
stir up strife among the Citizens. He uttered
Prophecies, he detected Villanies, he branded
people with all kind of Infamies. He incensed
the Neighbourhood against one Man particularly,
as the cause of all the mischiefs: who yet proved
himself innocent. He threw stones at the Inhabitants,
and at length burnt their Habitations, till
the Commission of the <i>Dæmon</i> could go no further.
I say, let us be well aware lest such <i>Dæmons</i>
do <i>Come hither also</i>.</p>

<p><i>III.</i> Inasmuch as the Devil is come down in
<i>Great Wrath</i>, we had need Labour, with all the
Care and Speed we can to Divert the <i>Great Wrath</i>
of Heaven from coming at the same time upon
us. The God of Heaven has with long and loud
Admonitions, been calling us to <i>a Reformation of
our Provoking Evils</i>, as the only way to avoid
that <i>Wrath</i> of His, which does not only <i>Threaten</i>
but <i>Consume</i> us. 'Tis because we have been Deaf
to those <i>Calls</i> that we are now by a provoked
God, laid open to the <i>Wrath</i> of the Devil himself.
It is said in Pr. 16. 7. <i>When a mans ways please
the Lord, he maketh even his Enemies to be at peace
with him.</i> The Devil is our grand <i>Enemy;</i> and
tho' we would not be at peace <i>with</i> him, yet we
would be at peace from him, that is, we would
have him unable to disquiet our <i>peace</i>. But inasmuch
as the <i>wrath</i> which we endure from this
<i>Enemy</i>, will allow us no <i>peace</i>, we may be sure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
<i>our ways have not pleased the Lord</i>. It is because
we have <i>broken the hedge</i> of Gods <i>Precepts</i>, that the
hedge of Gods <i>Providence</i> is not so entire as it uses
to be about us; but <i>Serpents</i> are <i>biting</i> of us. O
let us then set [47] our selves to make our <i>peace</i>
with our God, whom we have <i>displeased</i> by our
iniquities: and let us not imagine that we can encounter
the <i>Wrath</i> of the Devil, while there is
the <i>Wrath</i> of God Almighty to set that Mastiff
upon us. <span class="smcap">Reformation! Reformation!</span> has
been the repeated <i>Cry</i> of all the Judgments that
have hitherto been upon us; because we have been
as <i>deaf Adders</i> thereunto, the <i>Adders</i> of the Infernal
Pit are now hissing about us. At length,
as it was of old said, <i>Luke</i> 16. 30. <i>If one went unto
them from the dead, they will repent;</i> even so, there
are some come unto us from the <i>Damned</i>. The
great God has loosed the Bars of the Pit, so that
many <i>damned Spirits</i> are come in among us, to
make us <i>repent</i> of our Misdemeanours. The
means which the Lord had formerly employ'd for
our <i>awakening</i>, were such, that he might well have
said, <i>What could I have done more?</i> and yet after
all, he has done <i>more</i>, in some regards, than was
ever done for the awakening of any People in the
World. The things now done to awaken our
Enquiries after our <i>provoking Evils</i>, and our endeavours
to Reform those evils, are most <i>extraordinary</i>
things; for which cause I would freely
speak it, if we now do not some <i>extraordinary</i>
things in returning to God; we are the most <i>incurable</i>,
and I wish it be not quickly said, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
most <i>miserable</i> People under the Sun. Believe me,
'tis a time for all people to do something <i>extraordinary,
in searching and trying of their ways, and in
turning to the Lord</i>. It is at an <i>extraordinary</i> rate
of <i>Circumspection</i> and <i>Spiritual mindedness</i>, that we
should all now maintain a <i>walk with God</i>. At such
a time as this ought <i>Magistrates</i> to do something
<i>extraordinary</i> in promoting of what is laudable,
and in restraining and chastising of <i>Evil Doers</i>. At
such a time as this ought <i>Ministers</i> to do something
<i>extraordinary</i> in pulling the Souls of Men out of
the <i>Snares</i> of the Devil, not only by publick
Preaching, but by personal Visits and Counsels,
<i>from house to house</i>. At such a time as this ought
<i>Churches</i> to do something <i>extraordinary</i>, in <i>renewing</i>
of their Covenants, and in <i>remembring</i>, and
<i>reviving</i> the Obligations of what they have renewed.
Some admirable Designs about the <i>Reformation</i>
of Manners, have lately been on foot in
the English Nation, in pursuance of the most
excellent Admonitions which have been given for
it, by the Letters of Their Majesties.<a name="FNanchor_133_132" id="FNanchor_133_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_132" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Besides
the vigorous Agreements of the <i>Justices</i> here and
there in the Kingdom, assisted by godly Gentlemen
and Informers, to execute the <i>Laws</i> upon
prophane Offenders: there has been started a <i>Proposal</i>
for the well-affected people in every Parish,
to enter into orderly <i>Societies</i>, whereof every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>Member shall bind himself, not only to <i>avoid</i>
Prophaneness in himself, but also according unto
to their Place, to do their utmost in first <i>Reproving;</i>
and, if it must be so, then <i>Exposing</i>, and so
<i>Punishing</i>, as the Law directs, for others that shall
be guilty. It has been observed, that the English
Nation has had some of its greatest Successes,
upon some special and signal <i>Actions</i> this way;
and a discouragement given under Legal Proceedings
of this kind, must needs be very exercising
to the <i>Wise that observe these things</i>. But
O why should not <i>New-England</i> be the most forward
part of the English Nation in such <i>Reformations?</i>
Methinks I hear the Lord from Heaven
saying over us, <i>O that my People had hearkened
unto me; then I should soon have subdued the Devils,
as well as their other Enemies!</i> There have been
some feeble Essays towards <i>Reformation</i> of late in
our <i>Churches;</i> but, I pray what comes of them?
Do we stay till the <i>Storm</i> of his <i>Wrath</i> be over?
Nay, let us be doing what we can, as fast as we
can, to divert the <i>Storm</i>. The Devils having
broke in upon our World,<a name="FNanchor_134_133" id="FNanchor_134_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_133" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> there is great asking,
<i>Who is it that has brought them in?</i> And many do
by <i>Spectral</i> Exhibitions come to be <i>cry'd out</i>
upon. I hope in Gods time it will be found,
that among those that are thus <i>cry'd out</i> upon,
there are persons yet <i>Clear from the great Trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>gression;</i>
but indeed, all the <i>Unreformed</i> among us,
may justly be <i>cry'd out</i> upon, as having too much
of an hand in letting of the Devils into our Borders;
'tis <i>our</i> Worldliness, <i>our</i> Formality, <i>our</i>
Sensuality, and <i>our</i> Iniquity that has help'd this
letting of the Devils in. O let us then at last,
<i>consider our ways</i>. 'Tis a strange passage recorded
by Mr. <i>Clark</i><a name="FNanchor_135_134" id="FNanchor_135_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_134" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> in the Life of his Father That
the People of his Parish, refusing to be Reclaimed
from their <i>Sabbath breaking</i>, by all the zealous
Testimonies which that good Man bore against
it; at last, on a night after the people had retired
home from a Revelling Prophanation of the <i>Lords
Day</i>, there was heard a great Noise, with rattling
of Chains up and down the Town, and an horrid
Scent of Brimstone fill'd the Neighbourhood.
Upon which the <i>guilty Consciences</i> of the Wretches
told [48] them, the Devil was come to fetch them
away; and it so terrifi'd them, that an Eminent
<i>Reformation</i> follow'd the Sermons which that
Man of God Preached thereupon. Behold, Sinners,
behold and <i>wonder</i>, lest you <i>perish:</i> the very
<i>Devils</i> are walking about our Streets, with lengthened
<i>Chains</i>, making a dreadful Noise in our Ears,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>and <i>Brimstone</i> even without a Metaphor, is making
an hellish and horrid stench in our Nostrils.<a name="FNanchor_136_135" id="FNanchor_136_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_135" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> I
pray leave off all those things whereof your <i>guilty
Consciences</i> may now accuse you, lest these Devils
do yet more direfully fall upon you. <i>Reformation</i>
is at this time our only <i>Preservation</i>.</p>

<p><i>IV</i>. When the Devil is come down in <i>great
Wrath</i>, let every <i>great Vice</i> which may have a
more particular tendency to make us a Prey unto
that <i>Wrath</i>, come into a due discredit with us.
It is the general Concession of all men, who are
not become too <i>Unreasonable</i> for common Conversation,
that the Invitation of <i>Witchcrafts</i> is
the thing that has now introduced the Devil into
the midst of us. I say then, let not only all
<i>Witchcrafts</i> be duly abominated with us, but also
let us be duly watchful against all the <i>Steps</i> leading
thereunto. There are lesser <i>Sorceries</i> which
they say, are too frequent in our Land. As it
was said in 2 <i>King</i>. 17. 9. <i>The Children of</i> Israel
<i>did secretly those things that were not right, against
the Lord their God</i>. So 'tis to be feared, the
Children of <i>New-England</i> have <i>secretly</i> done
many things that have been pleasing to the Devil.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>They say, that in some Towns it has been an
usual thing for People to cure Hurts with <i>Spells</i>,
or to use detestable Conjurations, with <i>Sieves</i>,
<i>Keys</i>, and <i>Pease</i>, and <i>Nails</i>, and <i>Horse-shoes</i>, and I
know not what other Implements, to learn the
things for which they have a forbidden, and an
impious <i>Curiosity</i>.<a name="FNanchor_137_136" id="FNanchor_137_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_136" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> 'Tis in the Devils Name,
that such things are done; and in Gods Name I
do this day charge them, as vile Impieties. By
these Courses 'tis, that People play upon <i>The Hole
of the Asp</i>, till that cruelly venemous <i>Asp</i> has
pull'd many of them into the deep <i>Hole</i> of <i>Witchcraft</i>
it self. It has been acknowledged by some
who have sunk the deepest into this <i>horrible Pit</i>,
that they began at these little <i>Witchcrafts;</i> on
which 'tis pity but the Laws of the English Nation,
whereby the incorrigible repetition of those
<i>Tricks</i>, is made <i>Felony</i>, were severally Executed.
From the like sinful <i>Curiosity</i> it is, that the Prognostications
of <i>Judicial Astrology</i>, are so injudiciously
regarded by multitudes among us; and
altho' the Jugling <i>Astrologers</i> do scarce ever hit
right, except it be in such <i>Weighty Judgments</i>,
forsooth, as that many <i>Old Men</i> will die such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>year, and that there will be many <i>Losses</i> felt by
some that venture to Sea, and that there will be
much <i>Lying</i> and <i>Cheating</i> in the World; yet their
foolish Admirers will not be perswaded but that
the Innocent <i>Stars</i> have been concern'd in these
Events. It is a disgrace to the English Nation,
that the Pamphlets of such idle, futil, trifling
<i>Stargazers</i> are so much considered; and the
Countenance hereby given to a Study, wherin at
last, all is done by <i>Impulse</i>, if any thing be done
to any purpose at all, is not a little perillous to
the Souls of Men. It is (<i>a Science</i>, I dare not call
it, but) a <i>Juggle</i>, whereof the Learned <i>Hall</i> well
says, <i>It is presumptious and unwarrantable, and cry'd
ever down by Councils and Fathers, as unlawful, as
that which lies in the mid-way between Magick and
Imposture, and partakes not a little of both</i>.<a name="FNanchor_138_137" id="FNanchor_138_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_137" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Men
consult the Aspects of Planets, whose Northern
or Southern motions receive denominations from
a <i>Cælestial Dragon</i>, till the <i>Infernal Dragon</i> at
length insinuate into them, with a <i>Poison</i> of
<i>Witchcraft</i> that can't be cured. Has there not
also been a world of discontent in our Borders?
'Tis no wonder, that the <i>fiery Serpents</i> are so
Stinging of us; We have been a <i>Murmuring Generation</i>.
It is not Irrational, to ascribe the late
Stupendious growth of <i>Witches</i> among us, partly
to the bitter <i>discontents</i>, which Affliction and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>Poverty has fill'd us with: it is inconceivable,
what advantage the Devil gains over men, by <i>discontent</i>.
Moreover, the Sin of <i>Unbelief</i> may be
reckoned as perhaps the chief <i>Crime</i> of our Land.
We are told, <i>God swears in wrath, against them
that believe not;</i> and what follows then but this,
<i>That the Devil comes unto them in wrath!</i> Never
were the offers of the <i>Gospel</i>, more freely tendered,
or more basely despised, among any People
under the whole Cope of Heaven, than in this
<i>N. E.</i><a name="FNanchor_139_138" id="FNanchor_139_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_138" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Seems it all marvellous unto us, that
the <i>Devil</i> should get such a footing in our Country?
Why, 'tis because the <i>Saviour</i> has been
slighted here, perhaps more than any where. The
Blessed Lord Jesus Christ [49] has been profering
to us, <i>Grace, and Glory, and every good thing</i>,
and been alluring of us to Accept of Him, with
such Terms as these, <i>Undone Sinner, I am All;
Art thou willing that I should be thy All?</i> But, as a
proof of that Contempt which this Unbelief has
cast upon these proffers, I would seriously ask of
the so many Hundreds above a Thousand People
within these Walls; which of you all, O how
few of you, can indeed say, <i>Christ is mine, and I
am his, and he is the Beloved of my Soul?</i> I would
only say thus much: When the precious and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>glorious Jesus, is Entreating of us to Receive <i>Him</i>,
in all His <i>Offices</i>, with all His <i>Benifits;</i> the Devil
minds what Respect we pay unto that Heavenly
Lord; if we <i>Refuse Him that speaks from Heaven</i>,
then he that, <i>Comes from Hell</i>, does with a sort of
claim set in, and cry out, <i>Lord, since this Wretch
is not willing that thou shouldst have him, I pray, let
me have him</i>. And thus, by the just vengeance of
Heaven, the Devil becomes a <i>Master</i>, a <i>Prince</i>, a
<i>God</i>, unto the miserable Unbelievers: but O what
are many of them then hurried unto! All of
these Evil Things, do I now set before you, as
<i>Branded</i> with the Mark of the Devil upon them.</p>

<p><i>V.</i> With <i>Great Regard</i>, with <i>Great Pity</i>, should
we Lay to Heart the Condition of those, who
are cast into Affliction, by the <i>Great Wrath</i> of
the Devil. There is a Number of our Good
Neighbours, and some of them very particularly
noted for Goodness and Vertue, of whom we may
say, <i>Lord, They are vexed with Devils</i>. Their
Tortures being primarily Inflicted on their <i>Spirits</i>,
may indeed cause the Impressions thereof upon
their Bodies to be the less <i>Durable</i>, tho' rather
the more <i>Sensible:</i> but they Endure Horrible
Things, and many have been actually Murdered.
Hard <i>Censures</i> now bestow'd upon these poor
Sufferers, cannot but be very Displeasing unto our
Lord, who, as He said, about some that had been
Butchered by a <i>Pilate</i>, in Luc. 13. 2, 3. <i>Think ye
that these were Sinners above others, because they
suffered such Things? I tell you No, But except ye</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
<i>Repent, ye shall all likewise Perish:</i> Even so, he
now says, <i>Think ye that they who now suffer by the
Devil, have been greater Sinners than their Neighbours?</i>
No, Do you Repent of your <i>own Sins</i>,
Lest the Devil come to fall foul of <i>you</i>, as he has
done to <i>them</i>. And if this be so, How <i>Rash</i> a
thing would it be, if such of the poor Sufferers,
as carry it with a Becoming Piety, Seriousness,
and Humiliation under their present Suffering,
should be unjustly <i>Censured;</i> or have their very
<i>Calamity</i> imputed unto them as a <i>Crime?</i> It is an
easie thing, for us to fall into the Fault of, <i>Adding
Affliction to the Afflicted</i>, and of, <i>Talking to the
Grief of those that are already wounded</i>. Nor can
it be wisdom to slight the Dangers of such a
Fault. In the mean time, We have no Bowels
in us, if we do not Compassionate the Distressed
County of <i>Essex</i>, now crying to all these Colonies,
<i>Have pity on me, O ye my Friends, Have pity on
me, for the Hand of the Lord has Touched me, and
the Wrath of the Devil has been therewithal turned
upon me</i>. But indeed, if an hearty <i>pity</i> be due to
any, I am sure, the Difficulties which attend our
Honourable <i>Judges</i>, do demand no Inconsiderable
share in that <i>Pity</i>. What a Difficult, what [50]
an Arduous Task, have those Worthy Personages
now upon their Hands? To carry the <i>Knife</i> so
exactly, that on the one side, there may be no
Innocent Blood Shed,<a name="FNanchor_140_139" id="FNanchor_140_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_139" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> by too unseeing a <i>Zeal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>for the Children of Israel;</i> and that on the other
side, there may be no Shelter given to those
Diabolical <i>Works of Darkness</i>, without the Removal
whereof we never shall have <i>Peace;</i> or to
those <i>Furies</i> whereof several have kill'd <i>more
people</i> perhaps than would serve to make a Village:
<i>Hic Labor, Hoc Opus est!</i> O what need have we,
to be concerned, that the Sins of our <i>Israel</i>, may
not provoke the God of Heaven to leave his
<i>Davids</i>, unto a wrong Step, in a matter of such
Consequence, as is now before them! Our Disingenuous,
Uncharitable, Unchristian Reproaching
of such <i>Faithful Men</i>, after all, <i>The Prayers
and Supplications, with strong Crying and Tears</i>,
with which we are daily plying the Throne of
Grace, that they may be kept, from what <i>They
Fear</i>, is none of the way for our preventing of
what We <i>Fear</i>. Nor all this while, ought our
<i>Pity</i> to forget such <i>Accused</i> ones, as call for indeed
our most Compassionate <i>Pity</i>, till there be
fuller Evidences that they are less worthy of it.<a name="FNanchor_141_140" id="FNanchor_141_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_140" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
If <i>Satan</i> have any where maliciously brought
upon the <i>Stage</i>, those that have hitherto had a
just and good stock of Reputation for their just
and good Living, among us; If the <i>Evil One</i>
have obtained a permission to <i>Appear</i>, in the
Figure of such as we have cause to think, have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>hitherto <i>Abstained</i>, even from the <i>Appearance of
Evil:</i> It is in Truth, such an Invasion upon <i>Mankind</i>,
as may well Raise an Horror in us all: But,
O what Compassions are due to such as may come
under such Misrepresentations, of the <i>Great Accuser!</i>
Who of us can say, what may be shewn
in the <i>Glasses</i> of the Great <i>Lying Spirit?</i> Altho'
the <i>Usual Providence</i> of God [we praise Him!]
keeps us from such a Mishap; yet where have
we an <i>Absolute Promise</i>, that we shall every one
always be kept from it? As long as <i>Charity</i> is
bound to Think <i>no Evil</i>, it will not Hurt us that
are <i>Private Persons</i>, to forbear the <i>Judgment</i>
which belongs not unto us. Let it rather be our
Wish, May the Lord help them to Learn the
<i>Lessons</i>, for which they are now put unto so hard
a School.</p>

<p><i>VI.</i> With a <i>Great Zeal</i>, we should lay hold on
the <i>Covenant</i> of God, that we may secure <i>Us</i> and
<i>Ours</i>, from the <i>Great Wrath</i>, with which the
Devil Rages. Let us come into the <i>Covenant of
Grace</i>, and then we shall not be hook'd into a
<i>Covenant with the Devil</i>, nor be altogether unfurnished
with Armour against the Wretches that
are in that <i>Covenant</i>. The way to come under
the Saving Influences of the <i>New Covenant</i>, is, to
close with the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the All-sufficient
<i>Mediator</i> of it: Let us therefore do,
<i>that</i>, by Resigning up our selves unto the Saving,
Teaching, and Ruling Hands of this Blessed
<i>Mediator</i>. Then we shall be, what we read in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Jude 1. <i>Preserved in Christ Jesus:</i> That is, as
the <i>Destroying Angel</i>, could not meddle with such
as had been distinguished, by the Blood of the
<i>Passeover</i> on their Houses: Thus the Blood of the
Lord Jesus Christ, Sprinkled on our Souls, will
<i>Preserve</i> us from the Devil. The <i>Birds of prey</i>
(and indeed the <i>Devils</i> [51] most literally in the
shape of great <i>Birds!</i>) are flying about. Would
we find a Covert from these <i>Vultures?</i> Let us
then Hear our Lord Jesus from Heaven Clocquing<a name="FNanchor_142_141" id="FNanchor_142_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_141" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
unto us, <i>O that you would be gathered
under my wings!</i> Well; when this is done, Then
let us own the <i>Covenant</i>, which we are now come
into, by joining ourselves to a Particular <i>Church</i>,
walking in the Order of the Gospel; at the doing
whereof, according to that <i>Covenant</i> of God, We
give up Our selves unto the Lord, and in Him
unto One Another, While others have had their
Names Entred in the <i>Devils Book;</i> let our Names
be found in the <i>Church Book</i>, and let us be <i>Written
among the Living in Jerusalem</i>. By no means
let, <i>Church work</i> sink and fail in the midst of us;
but let the Tragical Accidents which now happen,
exceedingly Quicken that <i>work</i>. So many
of the <i>Rising Generation</i>, utterly forgetting the
Errand of our Fathers to build Churches in this
Wilderness, and so many of our <i>Cottages</i> being
allow'd to Live, where they do not, and perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>cannot, wait upon God with the Churches of His
People; 'tis as likely as any one thing to procure
the swarmings of <i>Witch crafts</i> among us.<a name="FNanchor_143_142" id="FNanchor_143_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_142" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> But
it becomes us, with a like Ardour, to bring our
poor <i>Children</i> with us, as we shall do, when we
come our selves, into the <i>Covenant</i> of God. It
would break an heart of Stone, to have seen,
what I have lately seen; Even poor Children of
several Ages, even from seven to twenty, more or
less, <i>Confessing</i> their Familiarity with Devils; but
at the same time, in Doleful bitter Lamentations,
that made a little Pourtraiture of <i>Hell</i> it self,
Expostulating with their execrable Parents, for
<i>Devoting</i> them to the Devil in their Infancy, and
so <i>Entailing</i> of Devillism upon them! Now, as
the Psalmist could say, <i>My Zeal hath consumed
me, because my Enemies have forgotten thy words:</i>
Even so, let the Nefarious wickedness of those
that have Explicitly dedicated their Children to
the Devil, even with Devilish Symbols, of such a
Dedication, Provoke our <i>Zeal</i> to have our Children,
Sincerely, Signally, and openly <i>Consecrated</i>
unto God; with an <i>Education</i> afterwards assuring
and confirming that Consecration.</p>

<p><i>VII.</i> Let our <i>Prayer</i> go up with great Faith,
against the Devil, that comes down in great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>Wrath. Such is the Antipathy of the Devil to
our <i>Prayer</i>, that he cannot bear to stay long
where much of it is: Indeed it is <i>Diaboli Flagellum</i>,
as well as <i>Miseriæ Remedium;</i> the Devil will
soon be Scourg'd out of the Lord's Temple, by a
<i>Whip</i>, made and used, with the <i>effectual fervent
Prayer of Righteous Men</i>. When the Devil by
Afflicting of us, drives us to our Prayers, he is
<i>The Fool making a Whip for his own Back</i>. Our
Lord said of the Devil in <i>Matt.</i> 17. 21. <i>This
Kind goes not out, but by Prayer and Fasting.</i> But,
<i>Prayer and Fasting</i> will soon make the Devil be
gone. Here are <i>Charms</i> indeed! Sacred and
blessed <i>Charms</i>, which the Devil cannot stand
before. A Promise of God, being well managed
in the <i>Hands</i> of them that are much upon their
Knees, will so resist the Devil, that he will <i>Flee
from us</i>. At every other Weapon the Devils will
be too hard for us; the <i>Spiritual Wickednesses in
High Places</i>, have manifestly the Upper hand of
[52] us; that <i>Old Serpent</i> will be too old for us,
too cunning, too subtil; they will soon <i>out wit</i> us,
if we think to Encounter them with any <i>Wit</i> of
our own. But when we come to <i>Prayers</i>, Incessant
and Vehement <i>Prayers</i> before the Lord, there
we shall be too hard for them. When well-directed
<i>Prayers</i>, that great Artillery of Heaven,
are brought into the Field, <i>There</i> methinks I see,
<i>There are these workers of Iniquity fallen, all of
them!</i> And who can tell, how much the most
<i>Obscure Christian</i> among you all, may do towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>the Deliverance of our Land from the Molestations
which the Devil is now giving to us. I
have Read, That on a day of Prayer kept by some
good People for and with a Possessed Person, the
Devil at last flew out of the Window, and referring
to a Devout, plain, mean Woman then in
the Room, he cry'd out, <i>O the Woman behind the
Door!</i><a name="FNanchor_144_143" id="FNanchor_144_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_143" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> <i>'Tis that Woman that forces me away!</i>
Thus the Devil that now troubles us, may be
forced within a while to forsake us; and it shall
be said, <i>He was driven away by the Prayers of
some Obscure and Retired Souls, which the World has
taken but little notice of!</i> The Great God is about a
Great <i>Work</i> at this day among us: Now, there is
extream Hazard, lest the Devil who by Compulsion
must submit unto that <i>Great Work</i>, may also by
<i>Permission</i>, come to Confound that <i>Work;</i> both
in the Detections of some, and in the Confessions
of others, whose Ungodly deeds may be brought
forth, by a <i>Great Work</i> of God; there is Hazard
lest the Devil intertwist some of his Delusions.
'Tis <span class="smcap">Prayer</span>, I say, 'tis <span class="smcap">Prayer</span>, that
must carry us well through the strange things
that are now upon us. Only that Prayer must
then be the Prayer of Faith: O where is our
Faith in him, Who <i>hath spoiled these Principalities
and Powers, on his Cross, Triumphing over them!</i></p>

<p><i>VIII.</i> Lastly, Shake off, every Soul, shake off
the <i>hard Yoak</i> of the Devil. Where 'tis said, <i>The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>whole World lyes in Wickedness;</i> 'tis by some of the
Ancients rendred, <i>The whole World lyes in the
Devil</i>. The Devil is a Prince, yea, the Devil is a
God unto all the Unregenerate; and alas, there is
<i>A whole World of them</i>.<a name="FNanchor_145_144" id="FNanchor_145_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_144" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Desolate Sinners, consider
what an horrid Lord it is that you are
Enslav'd unto; and Oh shake off your Slavery to
such a Lord. Instead of <i>him</i>, now make your
Choice of the Eternal God in Jesus Christ; Chuse
him with a most unalterable Resolution, and unto
him say, with <i>Thomas, My Lord, and my God!</i>
Say with the Church, <i>Lord, other Lords have had
the Dominion over us, but now thou alone shalt be our
Lord for ever</i>. Then instead of your Perishing
under the wrath of the Devils, God will fetch
you to a place among those that fill up the Room
of the Devils, left by their Fall from the Ethereal
Regions. It was a most awful Speech made by
the Devil, Possessing a young Woman, at a Village
in <i>Germany, By the command of God, I am come to
Torment the Body of this young Woman, tho I cannot
hurt her Soul; and it is that I may warn Men,
to take heed of sinning against God. Indeed</i> (said he)
<i>'tis very sore against my will that I do it; but the
command of God forces me to declare what I do;
however I know that at the Last Day, I shall have
more Souls than God himself</i>. So spoke that horrible
Devil! But O that none [53] of our Souls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>may be found among the Prizes of the Devil, in
the Day of God! O that what the Devil has
been forced to declare, of his Kingdom among
us, may prejudice our Hearts against him for
ever!</p>

<p>My Text says, <i>The Devil is come down in great
Wrath, for he has but a short time</i>. Yea, but if
you do not by a speedy and through Conversion to
God, escape the Wrath of the Devil, you will
your selves go down, where the Devil is to be,
and you will there be sweltring under the Devils
Wrath, not for a <i>short Time</i>, but <i>World without
end;</i> not for a <i>Short Time</i> but for <i>Infinite Millions
of Ages</i>. The smoke of your Torment under
that Wrath, will <i>Ascend for ever and ever!</i> Indeed,
the Devil's time for his Wrath upon you in
this World, can be but short, but his time for you
to do his Work, or, which is all one, to delay
your turning to God, that is a <i>Long Time</i>. When
the Devil was going to be Dispossessed of a Man,
he Roar'd out, <i>Am I to be Tormented before my
time?</i> You will <i>Torment</i> the Devil, if you Rescue
your Souls out of his hands, by true Repentance:
If once you begin to look that way, he'll Cry
out, <i>O this is before my Time, I must have more
Time, yet in the Service of such a guilty Soul</i>. But,
I beseech you, let us join thus to torment the
Devil, in an holy Revenge upon him, for all the
Injuries which he has done unto us; let us tell
him, <i>Satan, thy time with me is but short, Nay, thy
time with me shall be no more; I am unutterably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
sorry that it has been so much; Depart from me thou
Evil-Doer, that would'st have me an Evil-Doer like
thy self; I will now for ever keep the Commandments
of that God, in whom I Live and Move, and
have my Being!</i> The Devil has plaid a fine Game
for himself indeed, if by his troubling of our
Land, the Souls of many People should come to
<i>think upon their ways, till even they turn their Feet
into the Testimonies of the Lord</i>. Now that the
Devil may be thus outshot in his own Bow, is the
desire of all that love the Salvation of God among
us, as well as of him, who has thus Addressed
you. <i>Amen.</i></p>

<p class="p2 dropcap">HAVING thus discoursed on the <i>Wonders of
the Invisible World</i>, I shall now, with God's
help, go on to relate some Remarkable and Memorable
Instances of <i>Wonders</i> which that <i>World</i>
has given to ourselves. And altho the chief Entertainment
which my Readers do expect, and
shall receive, will be a true History of what has
occurred, respecting the <span class="smcap">Witchcrafts</span> wherewith
we are at this day Persecuted; yet I shall
choose to usher in the mention of those things,
with</p>


<p class="hang p2"><i>A Narrative of an</i> <span class="smcap">Apparition</span> <i>which a Gentleman
in</i> <span class="smcap">Boston</span>, <i>had of his Brother, just then
murthered in</i> <span class="smcap">London</span>.</p>

<p class="dropcap">IT was on the Second of <i>May</i> in the Year 1687,
that a most ingenious, accomplished and well-disposed
young Gentleman, Mr. <i>Joseph Beacon</i>, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
about Five a Clock in the Morning, as he lay,
whether Sleeping or [54] Waking he could not
say, (but judged the latter of them) had a View
of his Brother then at <i>London</i>, altho he was now
himself at our <i>Boston</i>, distanced from him a thousand
Leagues.<a name="FNanchor_146_145" id="FNanchor_146_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_145" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> This his Brother appear'd unto
him, in the Morning about Five a Clock at <i>Boston</i>,
having on him a <i>Bengal</i> Gown, which he
usually wore, with a Napkin tyed about his Head;
his Countenance was very Pale, Gastly, Deadly,
and he had a bloody Wound on one side of his
Fore-head. <i>Brother!</i> says the Affrighted <i>Joseph.
Brother!</i> Answered the Apparition. Said <i>Joseph,
What's the matter Brother? How came you here!</i>
The Apparition replied, <i>Brother, I have been most
barbarously and injuriously Butchered, by a Debauched
Drunken Fellow, to whom I never did any wrong in
my Life</i>. Whereupon he gave a particular Description
of the Murderer; adding, <i>Brother, This
Fellow changing his Name, is attempting to come
over unto</i> New-England, <i>in</i> Foy, <i>or</i> Wild; <i>I
would pray you on the first Arrival of either of these,
to get an Order from the Governor, to Seize the
Person, whom I have now described; and then do
you Indict him for the Murder of me your Brother:
I'll stand by you and prove the Indictment</i>. And so
he Vanished. Mr. <i>Beacon</i> was extreamly astonished
at what he had seen and hear'd; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>People of the Family not only observed an extraordinary
Alteration upon him, for the Week following,
but have also given me under their Hands
a full Testimony, that he then gave them an Account
of this Apparition.</p>

<p>All this while, Mr. <i>Beacon</i> had no advice of any
thing amiss attending his Brother then in <i>England;</i>
but about the latter end of <i>June</i> following, he
understood by the common ways of Communication,
that the <i>April</i> before, his Brother going in
haste by Night to call a Coach for a Lady, met a
Fellow then in Drink, with his <i>Doxy</i> in his
Hand: Some way or other the Fellow thought
himself Affronted with the hasty passage of this
<i>Beacon</i>, and immediately ran into the Fire-side of
a Neighbouring Tavern, from whence he fetched
out a Fire-fork, wherewith he grievously wounded
<i>Beacon</i> in the Skull; even in that very part where
the Apparition show'd his Wound. Of this
Wound he Languished until he Dyed on the
Second of <i>May</i>, about five of the Clock in the
Morning at <i>London</i>. The Murderer it seems was
endeavouring an Escape, as the Apparition affirm'd,
but the Friends of the Deceased <i>Beacon</i>, Seized
him; and Prosecuting him at Law, he found the
help of such Friends as brought him off without
the loss of his Life; since which, there has no
more been heard of the Business.</p>

<p>This History I received of Mr. <i>Joseph Beacon</i>
himself; who a little before his own Pious and
hopeful Death, which follow'd not long after,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
gave me the Story written and signed with his
own Hand, and attested with the Circumstances
I have already mentioned.</p>



<p class="p2 dropcap">BUT I shall no longer detain my Reader, from
his expected Entertainment, in a brief account
of the Tryals which have passed upon some
of the Malefactors lately Executed at <i>Salem</i>, for
the <i>Witchcrafts</i> whereof they stood Convicted.
For my own part, I was not present at any of
them; [55] nor ever had I any Personal prejudice
at the Persons thus brought upon the Stage;
much less at the Surviving Relations of those
Persons, with and for whom I would be as hearty
a Mourner as any Man living in the World:
<i>The Lord Comfort them!</i> But having received a
Command so to do, I can do no other than shortly
relate the chief <i>Matters of Fact</i>, which occur'd
in the Tryals of some that were Executed, in an
Abridgment Collected out of the <i>Court-Papers</i>,
on this occasion put into my hands. You are to
take the <i>Truth</i>, just as it was; and the Truth will
hurt no good Man. There might have been
more of these, if my Book would not thereby
have swollen too big; and if some other worthy
hands did not perhaps intend something further
in these <i>Collections;</i> for which cause I have only
singled out Four or Five, which may serve to
illustrate the way of Dealing, wherein <i>Witchcrafts</i>
use to be concerned; and I report matters
not as an <i>Advocate</i>, but as an <i>Historian</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>

They were some of the Gracious Words inserted
in the Advice, which many of the Neighbouring
Ministers, did this Summer humbly lay
before our Honorable Judges, <i>We cannot but with
all thankfulness, acknowledge the success which the
Merciful God has given unto the Sedulous and Assiduous
endeavours of Our Honourable Rulers, to detect
the abominable Witchcrafts which have been committed
in the Country; Humbly Praying, that the
discovery of those mysterious and mischievous wickednesses,
may be Perfected</i>. If in the midst of the
many Dissatisfactions among us, the Publication
of these Tryals may promote such a Pious Thankfulness
unto God, for Justice being so far executed
among us, I shall Rejoice that God is
Glorified; and pray, that no wrong steps of ours
may ever sully any of his Glorious Works. But
we will begin with,</p>



<p class="hang"><i>A Modern Instance of Witches, Discovered and
Condemned in a Tryal, before that celebrated
Judge, Sir Matthew Hale</i>.<a name="FNanchor_147_146" id="FNanchor_147_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_146" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>


<p class="dropcap">IT may cast some Light upon the Dark things
now in <i>America</i>, if we just give a glance upon
the <i>like things</i> lately happening in <i>Europe</i>. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>may see the <i>Witchcrafts</i> here most exactly resemble
the <i>Witchcrafts</i> there; and we may learn
what sort of Devils do trouble the World.</p>

<p>The Venerable <i>Baxter</i> very truly says, <i>Judge</i>
Hale <i>was a Person, than whom, no Man was more
Backward to Condemn a Witch, without full Evidence</i>.</p>

<p>Now, one of the latest Printed Accounts about
a <i>Tryal of Witches</i>, is of what was before him,
and it ran on this wise. [Printed in the Year 1682.]
And it is here the rather mentioned, because it
was a Tryal, much considered by the Judges of
<i>New England</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
<i>I. Rose Cullender</i> and <i>Amy Duny</i>, were severally
Indicted, for Bewitching <i>Elizabeth Durent</i>, <i>Ann
Durent</i>, <i>Jane Bocking</i>, <i>Susan Chandler</i>, <i>William
Durent</i>, <i>Elizabeth</i> and <i>Deborah Pacy</i>. And the
Evidence whereon they were Convicted, stood
upon divers particular Circumstances.</p>

<p>[56] <i>II. Ann Durent</i>, <i>Susan Chandler</i>, and <i>Elizabeth
Pacy</i>, when they came into the Hall, to give
Instructions for the drawing the Bills of Indictments,
they fell into strange and violent Fits, so
that they were unable to give in their Depositions,
not only then, but also during the whole
Assizes. <i>William Durent</i> being an Infant, his
Mother Swore, that <i>Amy Duny</i> looking after her
Child one Day in her absence, did at her return
confess, that she had <i>given suck to the Child:</i> (tho'
she were an Old Woman:) Whereat, when <i>Durent</i>
expressed her displeasure, <i>Duny</i> went away with
Discontents and Menaces.</p>

<p>The Night after, the Child fell into strange
and sad Fits, wherein it continued for Divers
Weeks. One Doctor <i>Jacob</i> advised her to hang
up the Childs Blanket, in the Chimney Corner
all Day, and at Night when she went to put the
Child into it, if she found any Thing in it then
to throw it without fear into the Fire. Accordingly,
at Night, there fell a great Toad out of
the Blanket, which ran up and down the Hearth.
A Boy catch't it, and held it in the Fire with
the Tongs: where it made an horrible Noise,
and Flash'd like to Gun-Powder, with a report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
like that of a Pistol: Whereupon the Toad was no
more to be seen. The next Day a Kinswoman of
<i>Duny's</i>, told the Deponent, that her Aunt was all
grievously scorch'd with the Fire, and the Deponent
going to her House, found her in such a
Condition. <i>Duny</i> told her, she might thank her
for it; but she should live to see some of her
Children Dead, and herself upon Crutches. But
after the Burning of the Toad, this Child Recovered.</p>

<p>This Deponent further Testifi'd, That Her
Daughter <i>Elizabeth</i>, being about the Age of Ten
Years, was taken in like manner, as her first Child
was, and in her Fits complained much of <i>Amy
Duny</i>, and said, that she did appear to Her, and
afflict her in such a manner as the former. One
Day she found <i>Amy Duny</i> in her House, and
thrusting her out of Doors, <i>Duny</i> said, <i>You need
not be so Angry, your Child won't live long</i>. And
within three Days the Child died. The Deponent
added, that she was Her self, not long after
taken with such a Lameness in both her Legs,
that she was forced to go upon Crutches; and
she was now in Court upon them. [It was
Remarkable, that immediately upon the Juries
bringing in <i>Duny</i> Guilty, <i>Durent</i> was restored
unto the use of her Limbs, and went home without
her Crutches.]</p>

<p><i>III.</i> As for <i>Elizabeth</i> and <i>Deborah Pacy</i>, one
Aged Eleven Years, the other Nine; the elder,
being in Court, was made utterly senseless, during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
all the time of the Trial: or at least speechless.
By the direction of the Judge <i>Duny</i> was privately
brought to <i>Elizabeth Pacy</i>, and she touched her
Hand: whereupon the Child, without so much
as seeing her, suddenly leap'd up and flew upon
the Prisoner; the younger was too ill, to be
brought unto the Assizes. But <i>Samuel Pacy</i>, their
Father, testifi'd, that his Daughter <i>Deborah</i> was
taken with a sudden Lameness; and upon the
grumbling of <i>Amy Duny</i>, for being denied something,
where this Child was then [57] sitting, the
Child was taken with an extream pain in her
stomach, like the pricking of Pins; and shrieking
at a dreadful manner, like a Whelp, rather
than a Rational Creature. The Physicians could
not conjecture the cause of the Distemper; but
<i>Amy Duny</i> being a Woman of ill Fame, and the
Child in Fits crying out of <i>Amy Duny</i>, as affrighting
her with the Apparition of her Person, the
Deponent suspected her, and procured her to be
set in the stocks. While she was there, she said
in the hearing of Two Witnesses, <i>Mr.</i> Pacy <i>keeps
a great stir about his Child, but let him stay till he
has done as much by his Children, as I have done by
mine:</i> And being Asked, What she had done to her
Children, she Answered, <i>She had been fain to open
her Childs Mouth with a Tap to give it Victuals</i>.
The Deponent added, that within Two Days, the
Fits of his Daughters were such, that they could
not preserve either Life or Breath, without the
help of a Tap. And that the Children Cry'd out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
of <i>Amy Duny</i>, and of <i>Rose Cullender</i>, as afflicting
them with their Apparitions.</p>

<p><i>IV.</i> The Fits of the Children were various.
They would sometimes be Lame on one side;
sometimes on t'other. Sometimes very sore;
sometimes restored unto their Limbs, and then
Deaf, or Blind, or Dumb, for a long while together.
Upon the Recovery of their Speech,
they would Cough extreamly; and with much
Flegm, they would bring up Crooked Pins; and
one time, a Two-penny Nail, with a very broad
Head. Commonly at the end of every Fit, they
would cast up a Pin. When the Children Read,
they could not pronounce the Name of, <i>Lord</i>, or
<i>Jesus</i>, or <i>Christ</i>, but would fall into Fits; and
say, Amy Duny <i>says, I must not use that Name</i>.
When they came to the Name of <i>Satan</i>, or <i>Devil</i>,
they would clap their Fingers on the Book, crying
out, <i>This bites, but it makes me speak right
well!</i> The Children in their Fits would often
Cry out, <i>There stands</i> Amy Duny, or <i>Rose Cullender;</i>
and they would afterwards relate, <i>That
these Witches appearing before them, threatned them,
that if they told what they saw or heard, they would
Torment them ten times more than ever they did before</i>.</p>

<p><i>V. Margaret Arnold</i>, the Sister of Mr. <i>Pacy</i>,
Testifi'd unto the like Sufferings being upon the
Children, at her House, whither her Brother had
Removed them. And that sometimes, the Children
(<i>only</i>) would see things like Mice, run about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
the House; and one of them suddenly snap'd one
with the Tongs, and threw it into the Fire, where
it screeched out like a Rat. At another time, a
thing like a Bee, flew at the Face of the younger
Child; the Child fell into a Fit; and at last
Vomited up a <i>Two-penny Nail</i>, with a Broad Head;
affirming, <i>That the Bee brought this Nail, and
forced it into her Mouth</i>. The Child would in
like manner be assaulted with Flies, which
brought Crooked Pins, unto her, and made her
first swallow them, and then Vomit them. She
one Day caught an Invisible <i>Mouse</i>, and throwing
it into the Fire, it Flash'd like to Gun-Powder.
None besides the Child saw the <i>Mouse</i>, but every
one saw the <i>Flash</i>. She also de[58]clared, out of
her Fits, that in them, <i>Amy Duny</i> much tempted
her to destroy her self.</p>

<p><i>VI.</i> As for <i>Ann Durent</i>, her Father Testified,
That upon a Discontent of <i>Rose Cullender</i>, his
Daughter was taken with much Illness in her
Stomach and great and sore Pains, like the Pricking
of Pins: and then Swooning Fits, from which
Recovering, she declared, <i>She had seen the Apparition</i>
of Rose Cullender, <i>Threatning to Torment
her</i>. She likewise Vomited up diverse Pins. The
Maid was Present at Court, but when <i>Cullender</i>
look'd upon her, she fell into such Fits, as made
her utterly unable to declare any thing.</p>

<p><i>Ann Baldwin</i> deposed the same.</p>

<p><i>VII. Jane Bocking</i>, was too weak to be at the
Assizes. But her Mother Testifi'd, that her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Daughter having formerly been Afflicted with
Swooning Fits, and Recovered of them; was now
taken with a great Pain in her Stomach; and
New Swooning Fits. That she took little Food,
but every Day Vomited Crooked Pins. In her
first Fits, she would Extend her Arms, and use
Postures, as if she catched at something, and when
her Clutched Hands were forced open, they would
find several Pins diversely Crooked, unaccountably
lodged there. She would also maintain a Discourse
with some that were Invisibly present, when
casting abroad her Arms, she would often say, <i>I
will not have it!</i> but at last say, <i>Then I will have it!</i>
and closing her Hand, which when they presently
after opened, a Lath-Nail was found in it. But
her great Complaints were of being Visited by the
shapes of <i>Amy Duny</i>, and <i>Rose Cullender</i>.</p>

<p><i>VIII.</i> As for <i>Susan Chandler</i>, her Mother Testified,
That being at the search of <i>Rose Cullender</i>,
they found on her Belly a thing like a Teat, of
an Inch long; which the <i>said Rose</i> ascribed to a
strain. But near her Privy-parts, they found
Three more, that were smaller than the former.
At the end of the long Teat, there was a little
Hole, which appeared, as if newly Sucked; and
upon straining it, a white Milky matter issued
out. The Deponent further said, That her
Daughter being one Day concerned at <i>Rose Cullenders</i>
taking her by the Hand, she fell very sick,
and at Night cry'd out, <i>That</i> Rose Cullender
<i>would come to Bed unto her</i>. Her Fits grew violent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
and in the Intervals of them, she declared, <i>That
she saw</i> Rose Cullender <i>in them, and once having
of a great Dog with her</i>. She also Vomited up
Crooked Pins; and when she was brought into
Court, she fell into her Fits. She Recovered her
self in some Time, and was asked by the Court,
whether she was in a Condition to take an Oath,
and give Evidence. She said, she could; but
having been Sworn, she fell into her Fits again,
and, <i>Burn her! Burn her!</i> were all the words that
she could obtain power to speak. Her Father
likewise gave the same Testimony with her
Mother; as to all but the Search.</p>

<p><i>IX.</i> Here was the Sum of the Evidence:
Which Mr. Serjeant Keeling,<a name="FNanchor_148_147" id="FNanchor_148_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_147" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> thought not sufficient
to Convict the Prisoners. For admitting
the Chil[59]dren were Bewitched, yet, said he, it
can never be Apply'd unto the Prisoners, upon the
Imagination only of the Parties Afflicted; inasmuch
as no person whatsoever could then be in
Safety.</p>

<p>Dr. <i>Brown</i>, a very Learned Person then present,
gave his Opinion, that these Persons were Bewitched.
He added, That in <i>Denmark</i>, there
had been lately a great Discovery of Witches;
who used the very same way of Afflicting people,
by Conveying Pins and Nails into them. His
Opinion was, that the Devil in Witchcrafts, did
Work upon the Bodies of Men and Women, upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>a <i>Natural Foundation;</i> and that he did Extraordinarily
afflict them, with such Distempers as
their Bodies were most subject unto.</p>

<p><i>X.</i> The Experiment about the <i>Usefulness</i>, yea,
or <i>Lawfulness</i> whereof Good Men have sometimes
disputed, was divers Times made, That tho' the
Afflicted were utterly deprived of all sense in their
Fits, yet upon the <i>Touch</i> of the Accused, they
would so screech out, and fly up, as not upon any
other persons. And yet it was also found that
once upon the touch of an innocent person, the
like effect follow'd, which put the whole Court
unto a stand: altho' a small Reason was at length
attempted to be given for it.</p>

<p><i>XI.</i> However, to strengthen the Credit of what
had been already produced against the Prisoners,
One <i>John Soam</i> Testifi'd, That bringing home his
Hay in Three Carts, one of the Carts wrenched
the Window of <i>Rose Cullenders</i> House, whereupon
she flew out, with violent Threatenings
against the Deponent. The other Two Carts, passed
by Twice, Loaded, that Day afterwards; but the
Cart which touched <i>Cullenders</i> House, was Twice
or Thrice that Day overturned. Having again
Loaded it, as they brought it thro' the Gate which
Leads out of the Field, the Cart stuck so fast in
the Gates Head, that they could not possibly get
it thro', but were forced to cut down the Post of
the Gate, to make the Cart pass thro', altho' they
could not perceive that the Cart did of either side
touch the Gate-Post. They afterwards, did with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
much Difficulty get it home to the Yard; but
could not for their Lives get the Cart near the
place, where they should unload. They were
fain to unload at a great Distance; and when they
were Tired, the Noses of them that came to Assist
them, would burst forth a Bleeding; so they
were fain to give over till next morning; and
then they unloaded without any difficulty.</p>

<p><i>XII. Robert Sherringham</i> also Testifi'd, That
the Axle-Tree of his Cart, happening in passing,
to break some part of <i>Rose Cullenders</i> House, in
her Anger at it, she vehemently threatned him,
<i>His Horses should suffer for it</i>. And within a
short time, all his Four Horses dy'd; after which
he sustained many other Losses in the sudden
Dying of his Cattle. He was also taken with a
Lameness in his Limbs; and so vexed with Lice
of an extraordinary Number and Bigness, that no
Art could hinder the Swarming of them, till he
burnt up two Suits of Apparel.</p>

<p>[60] <i>XIII.</i> As for <i>Amy Duny</i>, 'twas Testifi'd
by one <i>Richard Spencer</i> that he heard her say, <i>The
Devil would not let her Rest; until she were Revenged
on the Wife of</i> Cornelius Sandswel. And
that <i>Sandswel</i> testifi'd, that her Poultry dy'd suddenly,
upon <i>Amy Dunys</i> threatning of them; and
that her Husbands Chimney fell, quickly after
<i>Duny</i> had spoken of such a disaster. And a Firkin
of Fish could not be kept from falling into the
Water, upon suspicious words of <i>Duny's</i>.</p>

<p><i>XIV.</i> The Judge told the Jury, they were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
inquire now, first, whether these Children were
Bewitched; and secondly, Whether the Prisoners
at the Bar were guilty of it. He made no doubt,
there were such Creatures as Witches; for the
Scriptures affirmed it; and the Wisdom of all
Nations had provided Laws against such persons.
He pray'd the God of Heaven to direct their
Hearts in the weighty thing they had in hand;
for, <i>To Condemn the Innocent, and let the Guilty go
free, were both an Abomination to the Lord</i>.</p>

<p>The Jury in half an hour brought them in
<i>Guilty</i> upon their several Indictments, which were
Nineteen in Number.</p>

<p>The next Morning, the Children with their
Parents, came to the Lodgings of the Lord Chief
Justice, and were in as good health as ever in their
Lives; being Restored within half an Hour after
the Witches were Convicted.</p>

<p>The Witches were Executed; and <i>Confessed</i>
nothing; which indeed will not be wondred by
them, who Consider and Entertain the Judgment
of a Judicious Writer, <i>That the Unpardonable Sin,
is most usually Committed by Professors of the Christian
Religion, falling into Witchcraft</i>.</p>

<p>We will now proceed unto several of the like
Tryals among ourselves.<a name="FNanchor_149_148" id="FNanchor_149_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_148" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

quite scarce, insomuch that
few could pretend to have seen
him; and hence People became
somewhat credulous about the Existence
of his Majesty, "as if
nothing but seeing the Devil could
satisfie them there was such a Person;
and nothing is more wonderful
to me, in the whole System of

<p><a name="Footnote_147_146" id="Footnote_147_146"></a><a href="#FNanchor_147_146"><span class="label">[147]</span></a> We are told by Bishop Burnet
(the Father of our Governor
Burnet), that Judge Hale was born
at Alderly in Gloucestershire, the
first of November, 1609, and died
on the 25th of December, 1676. In
the Life of Sir Matthew, appended
to his <i>Contemplations</i>, is given one of
the most interesting Pieces of Biography
extant. In Accordance with
one of his Sayings he was buried in
the Church-yard of Alderly, and
not in the Church, as was in his
Time the prevailing Custom&mdash;that Saying was: "The Churches were
for the Living, and the Church-yards
for the Dead." In the Bishop's
Life of him will be found a particular
Account of his Family. After
the great Fire of London he was
one of the principal Judges that sat
in Clifford's Inn, to regulate the
Affairs between Landlord and Tenant,
growing out of that Desolation.
And with Sir Orlando Bridgman
he rendered great Service in
accommodating Differences which
otherwise would long have retarded
the rebuilding of the City. Whereas
its "sudden and quiet building is
justly reconed one of the Wonders
of the Age." He was made "Lord
Chief Justice of England," May
18th, 1671, which Office he resigned
but a few Months previous
to his Death, owing to his Infirmity.
He lamented the rigorous Proceedings
against the Nonconformists,
though the adherent to the established
Church; and used to say,
"Those of the Separation were
good Men, but they had <i>narrow
Souls</i>, who would break the Peace
of the Church, about such <i>inconsiderable
Matters</i>, as the Points in Difference
were." There does not
appear to be taken any Notice of
the Trials of Witches by Burnet in
his Life of the Judge. It may be
sufficient to say, that, like our Judges,
Sewall and Stoughton, he was a
Believer in Witchcraft, because there
was Evidence of its Existence in the
Bible! He was a timid Man, and
this Timidity would not allow him so
much as "to sum up the Evidence"
in the Trial above given, and thus
was the Case submitted to the Jury,
who speedily gave in their Verdict
of Guilty. There can be no Doubt
but if Sir Matthew Hale had lived
until the End of the New England
Trials, he would, like Judge Sewall,
have repented of his Course.</p></div>

 THE TRYAL OF G. B.<br />

 <i>At a Court of</i> OYER <i>and</i> TERMINER, <br />

 <span class="smcap">Held in Salem</span>, 1692.</h3>


<p class="dropcap">GLAD should I have been, if I had never
known the Name of this Man; or never
had this occasion to mention so much as the first
Letters of his Name. But the Government requiring
some Account of his [61] Trial to be
inserted in this Book, it becomes me with all
Obedience to submit unto the Order.</p>

<p>I. This <i>G. B.</i><a name="FNanchor_150_149" id="FNanchor_150_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_149" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> was Indicted for Witch-craft,
and in the prosecution of the Charge against him,
he was Accused by five or six of the Bewitched, as
the Author of their Miseries; he was Accused by
Eight of the Confessing Witches, as being an head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>Actor at some of their Hellish Randezvouzes, and
one who had the promise of being a King in Satan's
Kingdom, now going to be Erected: He
was accused by Nine Persons for extraordinary
Lifting, and such feats of Strength, as could not
be done without a Diabolical Assistance. And
for other such things he was Accused, until about
thirty Testimonies were brought in against him;
nor were these judg'd the half of what might have
been considered for his Conviction: However they
were enough to fix the Character of a Witch
upon him according to the Rules of Reasoning,
by the Judicious <i>Gaule</i>, in that Case directed.</p>

<p>II. The Court being sensible, that the Testimonies
of the Parties Bewitched, use to have a
Room among the <i>Suspicions</i> or <i>Presumptions</i>,
brought in against one Indicted for Witchcraft;
there were now heard the Testimonies of several
Persons, who were most notoriously Bewitched,
and every day Tortured by Invisible Hands, and
these now all charged the Spectres of <i>G. B.</i> to
have a share in their Torments. At the Examination
of this <i>G. B.</i> the Bewitched People were
grievously harassed with Preternatural Mischiefs,
which could not possibly be dissembled; and they
still ascribed it unto the endeavours of <i>G. B.</i> to
Kill them. And now upon his Tryal of one of
the Bewitched Persons, testified, that in her
Agonies, a little black Hair'd Man came to her,
saying his Name was <i>B.</i> and bidding her set her
hand unto a Book which he shewed unto her; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
bragging that he was a <i>Conjurer</i>, above the ordinary
Rank of Witches; That he often Persecuted
her with the offer of that Book, saying, <i>She should
be well, and need fear nobody, if she would but Sign
it;</i> But he inflicted cruel Pains and Hurts upon
her, because of her denying so to do. The Testimonies
of the other Sufferers concurred with
these; and it was remarkable, that whereas <i>Biting</i>
was one of the ways which the Witches used for
the vexing of the Sufferers; when they cry'd out
of <i>G. B.</i> Biting them, the print of the Teeth
would be seen on the Flesh of the Complainers,
and just such a Set of Teeth as <i>G. B's</i> would then
appear upon them, which could be distinguished
from those of some other Mens. Others of them
testified, That in their Torments, <i>G. B.</i> tempted
them to go unto a Sacrament, unto which they
perceived him with a Sound of Trumpet, Summoning
of other Witches, who quickly after the
Sound, would come from all Quarters unto the
Rendezvouz. One of them falling into a kind of
Trance, afterwards affirmed, that <i>G. B.</i> had carried
her into a very high Mountain, where he shewed
her mighty and glorious Kingdoms, and said, <i>He
would give them all to her, if she would</i> [62] <i>write
in his Book;</i> but she told him, <i>They were none of his
to give;</i> and refused the Motions; enduring of
much Misery for that refusal.</p>

<p>It cost the Court a wonderful deal of Trouble,
to hear the Testimonies of the Sufferers; for when
they were going to give in their Depositions, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
would for a long time be taken with Fits, that
made them uncapable of saying anything. The
Chief Judg asked the Prisoner, who he thought
hindred these Witnesses from giving their <i>Testimonies?</i>
And he answered, <i>He supposed it was the
Devil</i>. That Honourable Person, then repli'd,
<i>How comes the Devil so loathe to have any Testimony
born against you?</i> Which cast him into very great
Confusion.<a name="FNanchor_151_150" id="FNanchor_151_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_150" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>III. It has been a frequent thing for the Bewitched
People to be entertained with Apparitions
of <i>Ghosts</i> of Murdered People, at the same
time that the <i>Spectres</i> of the Witches trouble
them. These Ghosts do always affright the Beholders
more than all the other spectral Representations;
and when they exhibit themselves,
they cry out, of being Murdered by the Witchcrafts
or other Violences of the Persons who are
then in Spectre present. It is further considerable,
that once or twice, these <i>Apparitions</i> have been
seen by others, at the very same time that they have
shewn themselves to the Bewitched; and seldom
have there been these <i>Apparitions</i>, but when
something unusual or suspected, have attended the
Death of the Party thus Appearing. Some that
have been accused by these <i>Apparitions</i> accosting
of the Bewitched People, who had never heard a
word of any such Persons ever being in the World,
have upon a fair Examination, freely and fully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>confessed the Murthers of those very Persons,
altho these also did not know how the Apparitions
had complained of them. Accordingly
several of the Bewitched, had given in their
Testimony, that they had been troubled with the
Apparitions of two Women, who said, that they
were <i>G. B's</i> two Wives, and that he had been the
Death of them; and that the Magistrates must be
told of it, before whom if <i>B.</i> upon his Tryal
denied it, they did not know but that they should
appear again in the Court. Now, <i>G. B.</i> had been
Infamous for the Barbarous usage of his two late
Wifes, all the Country over. Moreover, it was
testified, the Spectre of <i>G. B.</i> threatning of the
Sufferers, told them, he had Killed (besides others)
Mrs. <i>Lawson</i> and her Daughter <i>Ann</i>.<a name="FNanchor_152_151" id="FNanchor_152_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_151" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> And it
was noted, that these were the Vertuous Wife and
Daughter of one at whom this <i>G. B.</i> might have
a prejudice for his being serviceable at <i>Salem Village</i>,
from whence himself had in ill Terms removed
some Years before: And that when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>dy'd, which was long since, there were some odd
Circumstances about them, which made some of
the Attendents there suspect something of Witchcraft,
tho none Imagined from what Quarter it
should come.</p>

<p>Well, <i>G. B.</i> being now upon his Tryal, one of
the Bewitched Persons was cast into Horror at
the Ghost of <i>B's</i> two Deceased Wives then appearing
before him, and crying for <i>Vengeance</i>
against him. Hereupon seve[63]ral of the Bewitched
Persons were successively called in, who
all not knowing what the former had seen and
said, concurred in their Horror of the Apparition,
which they affirmed that he had before him. But
he, tho much appalled, utterly deny'd that he discerned
any thing of it; nor was it any part of his
<i>Conviction</i>.</p>

<p>IV. Iudicious Writers have assigned it a great
place in the Conviction of <i>Witches, when Persons
are Impeached by other notorious Witches, to be as
ill as themselves; especially, if the Persons have been
much noted for neglecting the Worship of God</i>. Now,
as there might have been Testimonies enough of
<i>G. B's</i> Antipathy to <i>Prayer</i>, and the other Ordinances
of God, tho by his Profession, singularly
Obliged thereunto; so, there now came in against
the Prisoner, the Testimonies of several Persons,
who confessed their own having been horrible
<i>Witches</i>, and ever since their Confessions, had been
themselves terribly Tortured by the Devils and
other Witches, even like the other Sufferers; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
therein undergone the Pains of many <i>Deaths</i> for
their Confessions.</p>

<p>These now testified, that <i>G. B.</i> had been at
Witch-meetings with them; and that he was the
Person who had Seduc'd, and Compell'd them
into the snares of Witchcraft: That he promised
them <i>Fine Cloaths</i>, for doing it; that he brought
Poppets to them, and Thorns to stick into those
Poppets, for the Afflicting of other People; and
that he exhorted them with the rest of the Crew,
to Bewitch all <i>Salem Village</i>, but besure to do it
Gradually; if they would prevail in what they
did.</p>

<p>When the <i>Lancashire Witches</i> were Condemn'd
I don't remember that there was any considerable
further Evidence, than that of the Bewitched,
and than that of some that confessed. We see so
much already against <i>G. B.</i> But this being indeed
not enough, there were other things to
render what had already been produced <i>credible</i>.</p>

<p>V. A famous Divine recites this among the
Convictions of a Witch; <i>The Testimony of the
party Bewitched, whether Pining or Dying; together
with the joint Oaths of sufficient Persons that have
seen certain Prodigious Pranks or Feats wrought by
the Party Accused</i>. Now, God had been pleased
so to leave this <i>G. B.</i> that he had ensnared himself
by several Instances, which he had formerly
given of a Preternatural Strength, and which
were now produced against him. He was a very
Puny Man, yet he had often done things beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
the strength of a Giant. A Gun of about seven
foot Barrel, and so heavy that strong Men could
not steadily hold it out with both hands; there
were several Testimonies, given in by Persons of
Credit and Honor, that he made nothing of taking
up such a Gun behind the Lock, with but one
hand, and holding it out like a Pistol, at Arms-end.
<i>G. B.</i> in his Vindication, was so foolish as
to say, That <i>an</i> Indian <i>was there, and held it out
at the same time:</i> Whereas none of the Spectators
ever saw any such <i>Indian;</i> but they supposed the
<i>Black Man</i>, (as the Witches call the Devil; and
they generally say he resembles an <i>Indian</i>) might
[64] give him that Assistance. There was Evidence
likewise brought in, that he made nothing
of taking up whole Barrels fill'd with <i>Malasses</i> or
<i>Cider</i>, in very disadvantageous Postures, and Carrying
of them through the difficultest Places out
of a Canoo to the Shore.</p>

<p>[Yea, there were two Testimonies that <i>G. B.</i>
with only putting the Fore Finger of his Right
hand into the Muzzle of an heavy Gun, a Fowling-piece
of about six or seven foot Barrel, did
lift up the Gun, and hold it out at Arms-end; a
Gun which the Deponents though strong Men
could not with both hands lift up, and hold out
at the But-end, as is usual. Indeed, one of these
Witnesses was over-perswaded by some Persons to
be out of the way upon <i>G. B's</i> Tryal; but he
came afterwards with Sorrow for his withdraw,
and gave in his Testimony: Nor were either of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
these Witnesses made use of as Evidences in the
Trial.]</p>

<p>VI. There came in several Testimonies relating
to the Domestick Affairs of <i>G. B.</i> which had a
very hard Aspect upon him; and not only prov'd
him a very ill Man; but also confirmed the belief
of the Character, which had been already
fastned on him.</p>

<p>'Twas testified, that keeping his two Successive
Wives in a strange kind of Slavery, he would
when he came home from abroad, pretend to tell
the Talk which any had with them; That he
has brought them to the point of Death, by his
harsh Dealings with his Wives, and then made
the People about him, to promise that in case
Death should happen, they would say nothing
of it; That he used all means to make his Wives
Write, Sign, Seal, and Swear a Covenant, never
to reveal any of his Secrets; That his Wives had
privately complained unto the Neighbours about
frightful Apparitions of Evil Spirits, with which
their House was sometimes infested; and that
many such things have been whispered among
the Neighbourhood. There were also some other
Testmonies relating to the Death of People
whereby the Consciences of an Impartial Jury
were convinced that <i>G. B.</i> had Bewitched the
Persons mentioned in the Complaints. But I am
forced to omit several passages, in this, as well as
in all the succeeding Tryals, because the Scribes
who took notice of them, have not supplyed me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>

VII. One Mr. <i>Ruck</i>, Brother-in-Law to this
<i>G. B.</i> testified, that <i>G. B.</i> and he himself, and his
Sister, who was <i>G. B's</i> Wife, going out for two or
three Miles to gather Straw-berries, <i>Ruck</i> with
his Sister, the Wife of <i>G. B.</i> Rode home very
Softly, with <i>G. B.</i> on Foot in their Company,
<i>G. B.</i> stept aside a little into the Bushes; whereupon
they halted and Halloo'd for him. He
not answering, they went away homewards, with
a quickened pace, without expectation of seeing
him in a considerable while; and yet when they
were got near home, to their Astonishment, they
found him on foot with them, having a Basket of
Straw-berries. <i>G. B.</i> immediately then fell to
Chiding his Wife, on the account of what she
had been speaking to her [65] Brother, of him,
on the Road: which when they wondred at, he
said, <i>He knew their thoughts</i>. <i>Ruck</i> being startled
at that, made some Reply, intimating, that the
Devil himself did not know so far; but <i>G. B.</i>
answered, <i>My God makes known your Thoughts
unto me</i>. The Prisoner now at the Bar had nothing
to answer, unto what was thus witnessed against
him, that was worth considering. Only he said,
<i>Ruck, and his Wife left a Man with him, when
they left him</i>. Which <i>Ruck</i> now affirm'd to be
false; and when the Court asked <i>G. B. What the
Man's Name was?</i> his Countenance was much
altered; nor could he say, who 'twas. But the
Court began to think, that he then step'd aside,
only that by the assistance of the <i>Black Man</i>, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
might put on his <i>Invisibility</i>, and in that <i>Fascinating
Mist</i>, gratifie his own Jealous Humour, to
hear what they said of him. Which trick of
rendring themselves <i>Invisible</i>, our Witches do in
their Confessions pretend, that they sometimes are
Masters of; and it is the more credible, because
there is Demonstration, that they often render
many other things utterly <i>Invisible</i>.</p>

<p>VIII. <i>Faltring, faulty, unconstant, and contrary
Answers upon judicial and deliberate Examination</i>,
are counted some unlucky Symptoms of Guilt, in
all Crimes, especially in Witchcrafts. Now there
never was a Prisoner more eminent for them,
than <i>G. B.</i> both at his Examination and on his
Trial. His <i>Tergiversations</i>, <i>Contradictions</i>, and
<i>Falshoods</i>, were very sensible: he had little to
say, but that he had heard some things that he
could not prove, Reflecting upon the Reputation
of some of the Witnesses. Only he gave in a
Paper to the Jury; wherein, altho' he had many
times before, granted, not only that there are
<i>Witches</i>, but also, that the present Sufferings of
the Country are the effects of <i>horrible Witchcrafts</i>,
yet he now goes to evince it, <i>That there neither
are, nor ever were Witches, that having made a
Compact with the Devil, can send a Devil to Torment
other people at a distance</i>. This Paper was
Transcribed out of <i>Ady;</i> which the Court presently
knew, as soon as they heard it. But he
said, he had taken none of it out of any Book;
for which, his Evasion afterwards, was, That a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Gentleman gave him the Discourse in a Manuscript,
from whence he Transcribed it.</p>

<p>IX. The Jury brought him in <i>Guilty:</i> But
when he came to Dy, he utterly deni'd the
Fact, whereof he had been thus convicted.<a name="FNanchor_153_152" id="FNanchor_153_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_152" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<h3>II. <i>The Tryal of</i> <span class="smcap">Bridget Bishop</span>,<a name="FNanchor_154_153" id="FNanchor_154_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_153" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> <i>alias Oliver,
at the Court of Oyer and Terminer, held at Salem,
June 2. 1692.</i></h3>

<p>I. <span class="dropcapa">S</span>HE was Indicted for Bewitching of several
Persons in the Neighbourhood, the Indictment
being drawn up, according to the <i>Form</i> in
[66] such Cases as usual. And pleading, <i>Not
Guilty</i>, there were brought in several persons, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>had long undergone many kinds of Miseries,
which were preternaturally inflicted, and generally
ascribed unto an <i>horrible Witchcraft</i>. There was
little occasion to prove the <i>Witchcraft</i>, it being
evident and notorious to all beholders. Now to
fix the <i>Witchcraft</i> on the Prisoner at the Bar, the
first thing used, was the Testimony of the <i>Bewitched;</i>
whereof several testifi'd, That the <i>Shape</i>
of the Prisoner did oftentimes very grivously
Pinch them, Choak them, Bite them, and Afflict
them; urging them to write their Names in a
<i>Book</i>, which the said Spectre called, <i>Ours</i>. One of
them did further testifie, that it was the <i>Shape</i> of
this Prisoner, with another, which one day took
her from her Wheel, and carrying her to the
River-side, threatned there to Drown her, if she
did not Sign to the <i>Book</i> mentioned: which yet
she refused. Others of them did also testifie, that
the said Shape did in her Threats brag to them
that she had been the Death of sundry Persons,
then by her named; that she had <i>Ridden</i> a Man
then likewise named. Another testifi'd, the Apparition
of <i>Ghosts</i> unto the Spectre of <i>Bishop</i>, crying
out, <i>You Murdered us!</i> About the Truth
whereof, there was in the Matter of Fact but too
much suspicion.</p>

<p>II. It was testifi'd, That at the Examination
of the Prisoner before the Magistrates, the Bewitched
were extreamly tortured. If she did but
cast her Eyes on them, they were presently struck
down; and this in such a manner as there could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
be no Collusion in the Business. But upon the
Touch of her Hand upon them, when they lay
in their Swoons, they would immediately Revive;
and not upon the Touch of any ones else. Moreover,
Upon some Special Actions of her Body, as
the shaking of her Head, or the turning of her
Eyes, they presently and painfully fell into the
like postures. And many of the like Accidents
now fell out, while she was at the Bar. One at
the same time testifying, That she said, <i>She could
not be troubled to see the afflicted thus tormented</i>.</p>

<p>III. There was Testimony likewise brought
in, that a Man striking once at the place, where
a bewitched person said, the <i>Shape</i> of this <i>Bishop</i>
stood, the bewitched cried out, <i>That he had tore
her Coat</i>, in the place then particularly specifi'd;
and the Woman's Coat was found to be Torn in
that very place.</p>

<p>IV. One <i>Deliverance Hobbs</i>,<a name="FNanchor_155_154" id="FNanchor_155_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_154" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> who had confessed
her being a Witch, was now tormented by
the Spectres, for her Confession. And she now
testifi'd, That this <i>Bishop</i> tempted her to Sign the
<i>Book</i> again, and to deny what she had confess'd.
She affirm'd, That it was the Shape of this Prisoner,
which whipped her with Iron Rods, to
compel her thereunto. And she affirmed, that
this <i>Bishop</i> was at a General Meeting of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>Witches, in a Field at <i>Salem</i>-Village, and there
partook of a Diabolical Sacrament in Bread and
Wine then administred.</p>

<p>[67] V. To render it further unquestionable,
that the Prisoner at the Bar, was the Person truly
charged in this <i>Witchcraft</i>, there were produced
many Evidences of <span class="smcap">OTHER</span> <i>Witchcrafts</i>, by her
perpetrated. For Instance, <i>John Cook</i> testifi'd,
That about five or six Years ago, one Morning,
about Sun-Rise, he was in his Chamber assaulted
by the <i>Shape</i> of this Prisoner: which look'd on
him, grinn'd at him, and very much hurt him
with a Blow on the side of the Head: and that
on the same day, about Noon, the same <i>Shape</i>
walked in the Room where he was, and an Apple
strangely flew out of his Hand, into the Lap of
his Mother, six or eight Foot from him.</p>

<p>VI. <i>Samuel Gray</i><a name="FNanchor_156_155" id="FNanchor_156_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_155" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> testifi'd, That about fourteen
Years ago, he wak'd on a Night, and saw the
Room where he lay full of Light; and that he
then saw plainly a Woman between the Cradle,
and the Bed-side, which look'd upon him. He
rose, and it vanished; tho' he found the Doors all
fast. Looking out at the Entry-door, he saw the
same Woman, in the same Garb again; and said,
<i>In God's Name, what do you come for?</i> He went
to Bed, and had the same Woman again assaulting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>him. The Child in the Cradle gave a great
Screech, and the Woman disappeared. It was
long before the Child could be quieted; and tho'
it were a very likely thriving Child, yet from this
time it pined away, and after divers Months, died
in a sad Conditon. He knew not <i>Bishop</i>, nor her
Name; but when he saw her after this, he knew
by her Countenance, and Apparel, and all Circumstances,
that it was the Apparition of this
<i>Bishop</i>, which had thus troubled him.</p>

<p>VII. <i>John Bly</i><a name="FNanchor_157_156" id="FNanchor_157_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_156" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> and his Wife testifi'd, That he
bought a Sow of <i>Edward Bishop</i>, the Husband of
the Prisoner; and was to pay the Price agreed,
unto another person. This Prisoner being angry
that she was thus hindred from fingring the Mony,
quarrell'd with <i>Bly</i>. Soon after which, the Sow
was taken with strange Fits; Jumping, Leaping,
and Knocking her Head against the Fence; she
seem'd Blind and Deaf, and would neither Eat
nor be Suck'd. Whereupon a Neighbour said, she
believed the Creature was <i>Over-looked;</i> and sundry
other Circumstances concurred, which made
the Deponents believe that <i>Bishop</i> had bewitched
it.</p>

<p>VIII. <i>Richard Coman</i><a name="FNanchor_158_157" id="FNanchor_158_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_157" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> testifi'd, That eight
Years ago, as he lay awake in his Bed, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>Light burning in the Room, he was annoy'd
with the Apparition of this <i>Bishop</i>, and of two
more that were strangers to him, who came and
oppressed him so, that he could neither stir himself,
nor wake any one else, and that he was the
Night after, molested again in the like manner; the
said <i>Bishop</i>, taking him by the Throat, and pulling
him almost out of the Bed. His Kinsman offered
for this Cause to lodge with him; and that
Night, as they were awake, discoursing together,
this <i>Coman</i> was once more visited by the Guests
which had formerly been so troublesom; his
Kinsman being at the same time strook speechless,
and unable to move Hand or [68] Foot. He
had laid his Sword by him, which these unhappy
Spectres did strive much to wrest from him; only
he held too fast for them. He then grew able to
call the People of his House; but altho' they
heard him, yet they had not power to speak or
stir; until at last, one of the People crying out,
<i>What's the matter?</i> The Spectres all vanished.</p>

<p>IX. <i>Samuel Shattock</i><a name="FNanchor_159_158" id="FNanchor_159_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_158" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> testifi'd, That in the
Year, 1680, this <i>Bridget Bishop</i>, often came to his
House upon such frivolous and foolish Errands,
that they suspected she came indeed with a purpose
of mischief. Presently, whereupon, his
eldest Child, which was of as promising Health
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>and Sense, as any Child of its Age, began to droop
exceedingly; and the oftner that <i>Bishop</i> came to
the House, the worse grew the Child. As the
Child would be standing at the Door, he would
be thrown and bruised against the Stones, by an
Invisible Hand, and in like sort knock his Face
against the sides of the House, and bruise it after
a miserable manner. After this <i>Bishop</i> would
bring him things to Dy, whereof he could not
imagin any use; and when she paid him a piece
of Mony, the Purse and Mony were unaccountably
conveyed out of a lock'd Box, and never seen
more. The Child was immediately, hereupon,
taken with terrible Fits, whereof his Friends
thought he would have dyed: Indeed he did almost
nothing but Cry and Sleep for several Months
together; and at length his Understanding was
utterly taken away. Among other Symptoms of
an Inchantment upon him, one was, That there
was a Board in the Garden, whereon he would
walk; and all the Invitations in the World could
never fetch him off. About 17 or 18 years
after,<a name="FNanchor_160_159" id="FNanchor_160_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_159" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> there came a Stranger to <i>Shattock's</i> House,
who seeing the Child, said, <i>This poor Child is Bewitched;
and you have a Neighbour living not far
off, who is a Witch</i>. He added, <i>Your Neighbour
has had a falling out with your Wife; and she said,
in her Heart, your Wife is a proud Woman, and she
would bring down her Pride in this Child</i>. He then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>remembred, that <i>Bishop</i> had parted from his
Wife in muttering and menacing Terms, a little
before the Child was taken Ill. The abovesaid
Stranger would needs carry the bewitched Boy
with him, to <i>Bishop's</i> House, on pretence of buying
a Pot of Cyder. The Woman entertained
him in a furious manner; and flew also upon the
Boy, scratching his Face till the Blood came; and
saying, <i>Thou Rogue, what dost thou bring this Fellow
here to plague me?</i> Now it seems the Man had said,
before he went, That he would fetch Blood of
<i>her</i>. Ever after the Boy was follow'd with
grievous Fits, which the Doctors themselves
generally ascribed unto <i>Witchcraft;</i> and wherein
he would be thrown still into the <i>Fire</i> or the
<i>Water</i>, if he were not constantly look'd after;
and it was verily believed that <i>Bishop</i> was the
cause of it.</p>

<p>X. <i>John Louder</i><a name="FNanchor_161_160" id="FNanchor_161_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_160" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> testifi'd, That upon some
little Controversy with <i>Bishop</i> about her Fowls,
going well to Bed, he did awake in the Night by
Moon[69]light, and did see clearly the likeness of
this Woman grievously oppressing him; in which
miserable condition she held him, unable to help
himself, till near Day. He told <i>Bishop</i> of this;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>but she deny'd it, and threatned him very much.
Quickly after this, being at home on a Lords day,
with the doors shut about him, he saw a black
Pig approach him; at which, he going to kick, it
vanished away. Immediately after, sitting down,
he saw a black Thing jump in at the Window,
and come and stand before him. The Body was
like that of a Monkey, the Feet like a Cocks,
but the Face much like a Mans. He being so
extreamly affrighted, that he could not speak; this
Monster spoke to him, and said, <i>I am a Messenger
sent unto you, for I understand that you are in some
Trouble of Mind, and if you will be ruled by me,
you shall want for nothing in this World</i>. Whereupon
he endeavoured to clap his Hands upon it;
but he could feel no substance; and it jumped out
of the Window again; but immediately came in
by the Porch, tho' the Doors were shut, and said,
<i>You had better take my Counsel!</i> He then struck
at it with a Stick, but struck only the Ground-sel,
and broke the Stick: The Arm with which he
struck was presently Disenabled, and it vanished
away. He presently went out at the Back-door,
and spied this <i>Bishop</i>, in her Orchard, going toward
her House; but he had not power to set one
foot forward unto her. Whereupon, returning into
the House, he was immediately accosted by the
Monster he had seen before; which Goblin was
now going to fly at him; whereat he cry'd out,
<i>The whole Armour of God be between me and you!</i>
So it sprang back, and flew over the Apple-tree;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
shaking many Apples off the Tree, in its flying
over. At its leap, it flung Dirt with its Feet
against the Stomack of the Man; whereon he
was then struck Dumb, and so continued for
three Days together. Upon the producing of this
Testimony, <i>Bishop</i> deny'd that she knew this Deponent:
Yet their two Orchards joined; and they
had often had their little Quarrels for some years
together.</p>

<p>XI. <i>William Stacy</i><a name="FNanchor_162_161" id="FNanchor_162_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_161" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> testify'd, That receiving
Mony of this <i>Bishop</i>, for work done by him; he
was gone but a matter of three Rods from her,
and looking for his Mony, found it unaccountably
gone from him. Some time after, <i>Bishop</i>
asked him, whether her Father would grind her
Grist for her? He demanded why? She reply'd,
<i>Because Folks count me a Witch</i>. He answered,
<i>No question but he will grind it for you</i>. Being
then gone about six Rods from her, with a small
Load in his Cart, suddenly the Off-wheel slump't;
and sunk down into an hole, upon plain Ground;
so that the Deponent was forced to get help for
the recovering of the Wheel: But stepping back
to look for the hole, which might give him this
Disaster, there was none at all to be found. Some
time after, he was waked in the Night; but it
seem'd as light as day; and he perfectly saw the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>shape of this <i>Bishop</i> [70] in the Room, troubling of
him; but upon her going out, all was dark again.
He charg'd <i>Bishop</i> afterwards with it, and she
deny'd it not; but was very angry. Quickly
after, this Deponent having been threatned by
<i>Bishop</i>, as he was in a dark Night going to the
Barn, he was very suddenly taken or lifted from
the Ground, and thrown against a Stone-wall:
After that, he was again hoisted up and thrown
down a Bank, at the end of his House. After
this again, passing by this <i>Bishop</i>, his Horse with
a small Load, striving to draw, all his Gears flew
to pieces, and the Cart fell down; and this Deponent
going then to lift a Bag of Corn, of about
two Bushels, could not budge it with all his
Might.</p>

<p>Many other Pranks of this <i>Bishop's</i> this Deponent
was ready to testify. He also testify'd, That
he verily believ'd, the said <i>Bishop</i> was the Instrument
of his Daughter <i>Priscilla's</i> Death; of which
suspicion, pregnant Reasons were assigned.</p>

<p>XII. To crown all, <i>John Bly</i> and <i>William Bly</i>
testify'd, That being employ'd by <i>Bridget Bishop</i>,
to help take down the Cellar-wall of the old
House wherein she formerly lived, they did in
holes of the said old Wall, find several <i>Poppets</i>,
made up of Rags and Hogs-brussels, with headless
Pins in them, the Points being outward;
whereof she could give no Account to the Court,
that was reasonable or tolerable.<a name="FNanchor_163_162" id="FNanchor_163_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_162" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>
<p>XIII. One thing that made against the Prisoner
was, her being evidently convicted of <i>gross
Lying</i> in the Court, several times, while she was
making her Plea; but besides this, a Jury of
Women found a preternatural Teat upon her
Body: But upon a second search, within 3 or 4
hours, there was no such thing to be seen. There
was also an Account of other People whom this
Woman had Afflicted; and there might have
been many more, if they had been enquired for;
but there was no need of them.</p>

<p>XIV. There was one very strange thing more,
with which the Court was newly entertained.
As this Woman was under a Guard, passing by
the great and spacious Meeting-house of <i>Salem</i>,
she gave a look towards the House: and immediately
a <i>Dæmon</i> invisibly entring the Meeting-house,
tore down a part of it; so that tho' there
was no Person to be seen there, yet the People,
at the noise, running in, found a Board, which
was strongly fastned with several Nails, transported
unto another quarter of the House.</p>

<h3>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
III. <i>The Tryal of</i> <span class="smcap">Susanna Martin</span>,<a name="FNanchor_164_163" id="FNanchor_164_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_163" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> <i>at the
Court of Oyer and Terminer, held by Adjournment
at Salem, June 29. 1692.</i></h3>

<p>I. <span class="dropcapa">S</span>US<i>ANNA MARTIN</i>, pleading <i>Not Guilty</i>
to the Indictment of <i>Witchcraft</i>, brought
in against her, there were produced the Evidences
of ma[71]ny Persons very sensibly and grievously
Bewitched; who all complained of the Prisoner
at the Bar, as the Person whom they believed the
cause of their Miseries. And now, as well as in
the other Trials, there was an extraordinary Endeavour
by <i>Witchcrafts</i>, with Cruel and frequent
Fits, to hinder the poor Sufferers from giving in
their Complaints, which the Court was forced
with much Patience to obtain, by much waiting
and watching for it.</p>

<p>II. There was now also an account given of
what passed at <span class="errauthor" title="read: the">he</span> first Examination before the
Magistrates. The Cast of her <i>Eye</i>, then striking
the afflicted People to the Ground, whether they
saw that Cast or no; there were these among
other Passages between the Magistrates and the
Examinate.</p>

<p><i>Magistrate.</i> Pray, what ails these People?</p>

<p><i>Martin.</i> I don't know.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
<i>Magistrate.</i> But what do you think ails them?</p>

<p><i>Martin.</i> I don't desire to spend my Judgment
upon it.</p>

<p><i>Magistrate.</i> Don't you think they are bewitch'd?</p>

<p><i>Martin.</i> No, I do not think they are.</p>

<p><i>Magistrate.</i> Tell us your Thoughts about them
then.</p>

<p><i>Martin.</i> No, my thoughts are my own, when
they are in, but when they are out they are anothers.
Their Master.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Magistrate.</i> Their Master? who do you think
is their Master?</p>

<p><i>Martin.</i> If they be dealing in the Black Art,
you may know as well as I.</p>

<p><i>Magistrate.</i> Well, what have you done towards
this?</p>

<p><i>Martin.</i> Nothing at all.</p>

<p><i>Magistrate.</i> Why, 'tis you or your Appearance.</p>

<p><i>Martin.</i> I cannot help it.</p>

<p><i>Magistrate.</i> Is it not <i>your</i> Master? How comes
your Appearance to hurt these?</p>

<p><i>Martin.</i> How do I know? He that appeared
in the Shape of <i>Samuel</i>, a glorified Saint, may
appear in any ones Shape.</p>

<p>It was then also noted in her, as in others like
her, that if the Afflicted went to approach her,
they were flung down to the Ground. And,
when she was asked the reason of it, she said, <i>I
cannot tell; it may be the Devil bears me more
Malice than another</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>

III. The Court accounted themselves, alarum'd
by these Things, to enquire further into the Conversation
of the Prisoner; and see what there
might occur, to render these Accusations further
credible. Whereupon, <i>John Allen</i> of <i>Salisbury</i>,
testify'd, That he refusing, because of the weakness
of his Oxen, to Cart some Staves at the request
of this <i>Martin</i>, she was displeased at it; and
said, <i>It had been as good that he had; for his Oxen
should never do him much more Service</i>. Whereupon
this Deponent said, <i>Dost thou threaten me,
thou old Witch? I'l throw thee into the Brook:</i>
Which [72] to avoid, she flew over the Bridge,
and escaped. But, as he was going home, one of
his Oxen tired, so that he was forced to Unyoke
him, that he might get him home. He then
put his Oxen, with many more, upon <i>Salisbury</i>
Beach, where Cattle did use to get <i>Flesh</i>. In a
few days, all the Oxen upon the Beach were
found by their Tracks, to have run unto the
Mouth of <i>Merrimack-River</i>, and not returned;
but the next day they were found come ashore
upon <i>Plum-Island</i>. They that sought them, used
all imaginable gentleness, but they would still
run away with a violence, that seemed wholly
Diabolical, till they came near the mouth of
<i>Merrimack-River;</i> when they ran right into the
Sea, swimming as far as they could be seen. One
of them then swam back again, with a swiftness,
amazing to the Beholders, who stood ready to
receive him, and help up his tired Carcass: But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
the Beast ran furiously up into the Island, and
from thence, through the Marshes, up into <i>Newbury</i>
Town, and so up into the Woods; and there
after a while found near <i>Amesbury</i>. So that, of
fourteen good Oxen, there was only this saved:
The rest were all cast up, some in one place, and
some in another, Drowned.</p>

<p>IV. <i>John Atkinson</i><a name="FNanchor_165_164" id="FNanchor_165_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_164" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> testifi'd, That he exchanged
a Cow with a Son of <i>Susanna Martin's</i>
whereat she muttered, and was unwilling he
should have it. Going to receive this Cow, tho'
he Hamstring'd her, and Halter'd her, she, of a
Tame Creature, grew so mad, that they could
scarce get her along. She broke all the Ropes
that were fastned unto her, and though she were
ty'd fast unto a Tree, yet she made her escape,
and gave them such further trouble, as they could
ascribe to no cause but Witchcraft.</p>

<p>V. <i>Bernard Peache</i><a name="FNanchor_166_165" id="FNanchor_166_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_165" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> testifi'd, That being in
Bed, on the Lord's-day Night, he heard a scrabbling
at the Window, whereat he then saw <i>Susanna
Martin</i> come in, and jump down upon the
Floor. She took hold of this Deponent's Feet,
and drawing his Body up into an Heap, she lay
upon him near Two Hours; in all which time
he could neither speak nor stir. At length,
when he could begin to move, he laid hold on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>her Hand, and pulling it up to his Mouth, he
bit three of her Fingers, as he judged, unto the
Bone. Whereupon she went from the Chamber,
down the Stairs, out at the Door. This Deponent
thereupon called unto the People of the
House, to advise them of what passed; and he
himself did follow her. The People saw her not;
but there being a Bucket at the Left-hand of the
Door, there was a drop of Blood found upon it;
and several more drops of Blood upon the Snow
newly fallen abroad: There was likewise the
print of her 2 Feet just without the Threshold;
but no more sign of any Footing further off.</p>

<p>At another time this Deponent was desired by
the Prisoner, to come unto an Husking of Corn,
at her House; and she said, <i>If he did not come, it
were better that he did!</i> He went not; but the
Night following, <i>Susanna</i> [73] <i>Martin</i>, as he
judged, and another came towards him. One of
them said, <i>Here he is!</i> but he having a Quarter-staff,
made a Blow at them. The Roof of the
Barn, broke his Blow; but following them to
the Window, he made another Blow at them,
and struck them down; yet they got up, and got
out, and he saw no more of them.</p>

<p>About this time, there was a Rumour about
the Town, that <i>Martin</i> had a Broken Head; but
the Deponent could say nothing to that.</p>

<p>The said <i>Peache</i> also testifi'd the Bewitching
the Cattle to Death, upon <i>Martin's</i> Discontents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>

VI. <i>Robert Downer</i><a name="FNanchor_167_166" id="FNanchor_167_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_166" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> testifi'd, That this Prisoner
being some Years ago prosecuted at Court
for a Witch, he then said unto her, <i>He believed
she was a Witch</i>. Whereat she being dissatisfied,
said, <i>That some She-Devil would shortly fetch him
away!</i> Which words were heard by others, as
well as himself. The Night following, as he lay
in his Bed, there came in at the Window, the
likeness of a <i>Cat</i>, which flew upon him, took fast
hold of his Throat, lay on him a considerable
while and almost killed him. At length he remembered
what <i>Susanna Martin</i> had threatned
the Day before; and with much striving he cried
out, <i>Avoid, thou She-Devil! In the Name of God
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Avoid!</i>
Whereupon it left him, leap'd on the Floor, and
flew out at the Window.</p>

<p>And there also came in several Testimonies,
that before ever <i>Downer</i> spoke a word of this Accident,
<i>Susanna Martin</i> and her Family had
related, <i>How this</i> Downer <i>had been handled!</i></p>

<p>VII. <i>John Kembal</i><a name="FNanchor_168_167" id="FNanchor_168_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_167" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> testified, that <i>Susanna
Martin</i>, upon a Causeless Disgust, had threatned
him, about a certain Cow of his, <i>That she should
never do him any more Good:</i> and it came to pass
accordingly. For soon after the Cow was found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>stark dead on the dry Ground, without any Distemper
to be discerned upon her. Upon which
he was followed with a strange Death upon more
of his Cattle, whereof he lost in one Spring to the
Value of Thirty Pounds. But the said <i>John
Kembal</i> had a further Testimony to give in
against the Prisoner which was truly admirable.</p>

<p>Being desirous to furnish himself with a Dog,
he applied himself to buy one of this <i>Martin</i>, who
had a Bitch with Whelps in her House. But she
not letting him have his choice, he said, he would
supply himself then at one <i>Blezdels</i>. Having
mark'd a Puppy, which he lik'd at <i>Blezdels</i>, he
met <i>George Martin</i>, the Husband of the Prisoner,
going by, who asked him, <i>Whether he would not
have one of his Wife's Puppies?</i> and he answered,
<i>No</i>. The same Day, <i>one Edmond Eliot</i>, being at
<i>Martin's</i> House, heard <i>George Martin</i> relate,
where this <i>Kembal</i> had been, and what he had
said. Whereupon <i>Susanna Martin</i> replied, <i>If I
live, I'll give him Puppies enough!</i> Within a few
days after, this <i>Kembal</i>, coming out of the Woods,
there arose a little Black [74] Cloud in the N.W.
and <i>Kembal</i> immediately felt a force upon him,
which made him not able to avoid running upon
the stumps of Trees, that were before him, albeit
he had a broad, plain Cart-way, before him; but
tho' he had his Ax also on his Shoulder, to endanger
him in his Falls, he could not forbear
going out of his way to tumble over them.
When he came below the Meeting House, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
appeared unto him, a little thing like a <i>Puppy</i>,
of a Darkish Colour; and it shot backwards and
forwards between his Legs. He had the Courage
to use all possible Endeavours of Cutting it with
his Ax; but he could not Hit it: the Puppy gave
a jump from him, and went, as to him it seem'd
to him into the Ground. Going a little further,
there appeared unto him a Black Puppy, somewhat
bigger than the first, but as Black as a Cole.
Its Motions were quicker than those of his Ax;
it flew at his Belly, and away; then at his Throat;
so, over his Shoulder one way, and then over his
Shoulder another way. His Heart now began to
fail him, and he thought the Dog would have
tore his Throat out. But he recovered himself,
and called upon God in his Distress; and naming
the Name of Jesus Christ, it vanished away at
once. The Deponent spoke not one Word of
these Accidents, for fear of affrighting his Wife.
But the next Morning, <i>Edmond Eliot</i>, going into
<i>Martin's</i> House, this Woman asked him where
<i>Kembal</i> was? He replied, <i>At home, a Bed, for
ought he knew</i>. She returned, <i>They say, he was
frighted last Night.</i>. <i>Eliot</i> asked, <i>With what?</i>
She answered, <i>With Puppies</i>. <i>Eliot</i> asked, <i>Where
she heard of it, for he had heard nothing of it?</i> She
rejoined, <i>About the Town</i>. Altho' <i>Kembal</i> had
mentioned the Matter to no Creature living.</p>

<p>VIII. <i>William Brown</i><a name="FNanchor_169_168" id="FNanchor_169_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_168" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> testifi'd, That Heaven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>having blessed him with a most Pious and Prudent
Wife, this Wife of his, one day met with
<i>Susanna Martin:</i> but when she approach'd just
unto her, <i>Martin</i> vanished out of sight, and left
her extreamly affrighted. After which time, the
said <i>Martin</i> often appear'd unto her, giving her
no little trouble; and when she did come, she was
visited with Birds, that sorely peck'd and prick'd
her; and sometimes, a Bunch, like a Pullet's Egg,
would rise in her Throat, ready to choak her, till
she cry'd out, <i>Witch, you shan't choak me!</i> While
this good Woman was in this extremity, the
Church appointed a Day of Prayer, on her behalf;
whereupon her Trouble ceas'd; and she saw not
<i>Martin</i> as formerly; and the Church, instead of
their Fast, gave Thanks for her Deliverance.
But a considerable while after, she being Summoned
to give in some Evidence at the Court,
against this <i>Martin</i>, quickly thereupon this <i>Martin</i>
came behind her, while she was milking her
Cow, and said unto her, <i>For thy defaming me at
Court, I'll make thee the miserablest Creature in the
World</i>. Soon after which, she fell into a strange
kind of distemper, and became horribly frantick,
and uncapable of any reasonable Action; the
Physicians de[75]claring, that her Distemper was
preternatural, and that some Devil had certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>bewitched her; and in that condition she now
remained.</p>

<p>IX. <i>Sarah Atkinson</i><a name="FNanchor_170_169" id="FNanchor_170_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_169" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> testify'd, That <i>Susanna
Martin</i> came from <i>Amesbury</i> to their House at
<i>Newbury</i>, in an extraordinary Season, when it
was not fit for any to Travel. She came (as she
said, unto <i>Atkinson</i>) all that long way on Foot.
She brag'd and shew'd how dry she was; nor
could it be perceived that so much as the Soles
of her Shoes were wet. <i>Atkinson</i> was amazed at
it; and professed, that she should her self have
been wet up to the knees, if she had then came
so far; but <i>Martin</i> reply'd, <i>She scorn'd to be
Drabbled!</i> It was noted, that this Testimony
upon her Trial, cast her in a very singular Confusion.</p>

<p>X. <i>John Pressy</i><a name="FNanchor_171_170" id="FNanchor_171_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_170" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> testify'd, That being one
Evening very unaccountably Bewildred, near a
Field of <i>Martins</i>, and several times, as one under
an Enchantment, returning to the place he had
left, at length he saw a marvellous Light, about
the bigness of an Half-bushel, near two Rod out
of the way. He went, and struck at it with a
Stick, and laid it on with all his might. He
gave it near forty blows; and felt it a palpable
substance. But going from it, his Heels were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>struck up, and he was laid with his Back on the
Ground, sliding, as he thought, into a Pit; from
whence he recover'd by taking hold on the Bush;
altho' afterwards he could find no such Pit in the
place. Having, after his Recovery, gone five or
six Rod, he saw <i>Susanna Martin</i> standing on his
Left-hand, as the Light had done before; but
they changed no words with one another. He
could scarce find his House in his Return; but
at length he got home extreamly affrighted.
The next day, it was upon Enquiry understood,
that <i>Martin</i> was in a miserable condition by pains
and hurts that were upon her.</p>

<p>It was further testify'd by this Deponent, That
after he had given in some Evidence against <i>Susanna
Martin</i>, many years ago, she gave him foul
words about it; and said, <i>He should never prosper
more;</i> particularly, <i>That he should never have more
than two Cows; that tho' he was never so likely to
have more, yet he should never have them</i>. And
that from that very day to this, namely for twenty
years together, he could never exceed that number;
but some strange thing or other still prevented
his having of any more.</p>

<p>XI. <i>Jervis Ring</i><a name="FNanchor_172_171" id="FNanchor_172_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_171" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> testify'd, That about seven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>years ago, he was oftentimes and grievously oppressed
in the Night, but saw not who troubled
him; until at last he Lying perfectly Awake,
plainly saw <i>Susanna Martin</i> approach him. She
came to him, and forceably bit him by the Finger;
so that the Print of the bite is now, so long
after, to be seen upon him.</p>

<p>XII. But besides all of these Evidences, there
was a most wonderful Account of one <i>Joseph
Ring</i>, produced on this occasion.</p>

<p>[76] This Man has been strangely carried about
by <i>Dæmons</i>, from one <i>Witch-meeting</i> to another,
for near two years together; and for one quarter
of this time, they have made him, and keep him
Dumb, tho' he is now again able to speak. There
was one <i>T. H.</i> who having, as 'tis judged, a design
of engaging this <i>Joseph Ring</i> in a snare of
Devillism, contrived a while, to bring this <i>Ring</i>
two Shillings in Debt unto him.</p>

<p>Afterwards, this poor Man would be visited
with unknown shapes, and this <i>T. H.</i> sometimes
among them; which would force him away with
them, unto unknown Places, where he saw Meetings,
Feastings, Dancings; and after his return,
wherein they hurried him along through the Air,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>he gave Demonstrations to the Neighbours, that
he had indeed been so transported. When he was
brought unto these hellish Meetings, one of the
first Things they still did unto him, was to give
him a knock on the Back, whereupon he was
ever as if bound with Chains, uncapable of stirring
out of the place, till they should release him.
He related, that there often came to him a Man,
who presented him a <i>Book</i>, whereto he would
have him set his Hand; promising to him, that
he should then have even what he would; and
presenting him with all the delectable Things,
Persons, and Places, that he could imagin. But
he refusing to subscribe, the business would end
with dreadful Shapes, Noises and Screeches, which
almost scared him out of his Wits. Once with
the Book, there was a Pen offered him, and an
Ink-horn with Liquor in it, that seemed like
Blood: but he never toucht it.</p>

<p>This Man did now affirm, That he saw the Prisoner
at several of those hellish Randezvouzes.</p>

<p>Note, this Woman was one of the most impudent,
scurrilous, wicked Creatures in the World;
and she did now throughout her whole Tryal,
discover herself to be such an one. Yet when
she was asked, what she had to say for self? Her
chief Plea was, <i>That she had led a most virtuous
and holy Life</i>.</p>

<h3>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
IV. <i>The Tryal of</i> <span class="smcap">Elizabeth How</span>,<a name="FNanchor_173_172" id="FNanchor_173_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_172" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> <i>at the Court
of Oyer and Terminer, held by Adjournment at
Salem June 30, 1692</i>.</h3>

<p>I. <span class="dropcapa">E</span><i>LIZABETH HOW</i> pleading <i>Not Guilty</i>
to the Indictment of Witchcrafts, then
charged upon her; the Court, according to the
usual Proceedings of the Courts in <i>England</i>, in
such Cases, began with hearing the Depositions
of several afflicted People, who were grievously
tortured by sensible and evident <i>Witchcrafts</i>, and
all complained of the Prisoner, as the cause of
their Trouble. It was also found that the Sufferers
were not able [77] to bear her <i>Look</i>, as likewise,
that in their greatest Swoons, they distinguished
her <i>Touch</i> from other Peoples, being
thereby raised out of them.</p>

<p>And there was other Testimony of People to
whom the shape of this <i>How</i>, gave trouble nine
or ten years ago.</p>

<p>II. It has been a most usual thing for the bewitched
Persons, at the same time that the <i>Spectres</i>,
representing the <i>Witches</i>, troubled them, to
be visited with Apparitions of <i>Ghosts</i>, pretending
to have been Murdered by the <i>Witches</i> then
represented. And sometimes the Confessions of
the Witches afterwards acknowledged those very
Murders, which these <i>Apparitions</i> charged upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>them; altho' they had never heard what Informations
had been given by the Sufferers.</p>

<p>There were such Apparitions of Ghosts testified
by some of the present Sufferers; and the Ghosts
affirmed, that this <i>How</i> had Murdered them:
Which things were <i>fear'd</i> but not <i>prov'd.</i></p>

<p>III. This <i>How</i> had made some Attempts of
joyning to the Church at <i>Ipswich</i>, several years
ago; but she was denyed an admission into that
Holy Society, partly through a suspicion of
Witchcraft, then urged against her. And there
now came in Testimony, of preternatural Mischiefs,
presently befalling some that had been
Instrumental to debar her from the Communion
whereupon she was intruding.</p>

<p>IV. There was a particular Deposition of <i>Joseph
Safford</i>,<a name="FNanchor_174_173" id="FNanchor_174_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_173" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> That his Wife had conceived an
extream Aversion to this <i>How</i>, on the Reports of
her Witchcrafts: But <i>How</i> one day, taking her
by the Hand, and saying, <i>I believe you are not
ignorant of the great Scandal that I lye under, by
an evil Report raised upon me</i>. She immediately,
unreasonably and unperswadeably, even like one
Enchanted, began to take this Woman's part.
<i>How</i> being soon after propounded, as desiring an
Admission to the Table of the Lord, some of the
pious Brethren were unsatisfy'd about her. The
Elders appointed a Meeting to hear Matters objected
against her; and no Arguments in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>World could hinder this Goodwife <i>Safford</i> from
going to the Lecture. She did indeed promise,
with much ado, that she would not go to the
Church-meeting, yet she could not refrain going
thither also. <i>How's</i> Affairs there were so canvased,
that she came off rather <i>Guilty</i> than <i>Cleared;</i>
nevertheless Goodwife <i>Safford</i> could not forbear
taking her by the Hand, and saying, <i>Tho' you are
Condemned before Men, you are justify'd before God</i>.
She was quickly taken in a very strange manner,
Frantick, Raving, Raging and crying out, <i>Goody</i>
How <i>must come into the Church; she is a precious
Saint; and tho' she be condemned before Men, she is
Justify'd before God</i>. So she continued [78] for
the space of two or three Hours; and then fell
into a Trance. But coming to her self, she cry'd
out, <i>Ha! I was mistaken;</i> and afterwards again
repeated, <i>Ha! I was mistaken!</i> Being asked by a
stander by, <i>Wherein?</i> she replyed, <i>I thought Goody</i>
How <i>had been a precious Saint of God, but now I
see she is a Witch: She has bewitched me, and my
Child, and we shall never be well, till there be a
Testimony for her, that she may be taken into the
Church</i>. And <i>How</i> said afterwards, that she was
very sorry to see <i>Safford</i> at the Church-meeting
mentioned. <i>Safford</i>, after this, declared herself
to be afflicted by the Shape of <i>How;</i> and from
that Shape she endured many Miseries.</p>

<p>V. <i>John How</i>, Brother to the Husband of the
Prisoner testified, that he refusing to accompany
the Prisoner unto her Examination, as was by
her desired, immediately some of his Cattle were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
Bewitched to Death, leaping three or four foot
high, turning about, speaking, falling, and dying
at once; and going to cut off an Ear, for an use
that might as well perhaps have been omitted,
the Hand wherein he held his Knife was taken
very numb, and so it remained, and full of Pain,
for several Days, being not well at this very Time.
And he suspected this Prisoner for the Author of
it.</p>

<p>VI. <i>Nehemiah Abbot</i><a name="FNanchor_175_174" id="FNanchor_175_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_174" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> testify'd, that unusual
and mischievous Accidents would befal his Cattle,
whenever he had any Difference with this Prisoner.
Once, particularly, she wished his Ox
choaked; and within a little while that Ox was
choaked with a Turnip in his Throat. At another
Time, refusing to lend his Horse, at the
Request of her Daughter, the Horse was in a
preternatural manner abused. And several other
odd things of that kind were testified.</p>

<p>VII. There came in Testimony, that one Goodwife
<i>Sherwin</i>, upon some Difference with <i>How</i>,
was Bewitched; and that she dyed, charging this
<i>How</i> with having an Hand in her Death. And
that other People had their Barrels of Drink unaccountably
mischieved, spoil'd and spilt, upon
their displeasing of her.</p>

<p>The things in themselves were trivial, but there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>being such a Course of them, it made them the
more to be considered. Among others, <i>Martha
Wood</i>, gave her Testimony, That a little after her
Father had been employed in gathering an account
of <i>How's</i> Conversation, they once and again lost
great Quantities of Drink out of their Vessels, in
such a manner, as they could ascribe to nothing
but Witchcraft. As also, That <i>How</i> giving her
some Apples, when she had eaten of them, she
was taken with a very strange kind of Amaze,
insomuch that she knew not what she said or
did.</p>

<p>VIII. There was likewise a Cluster of Depositions,
That one <i>Isaac Cummings</i><a name="FNanchor_176_175" id="FNanchor_176_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_175" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> refusing to
lend his Mare unto the Husband of this <i>How</i>,
the Mare was within a Day or two taken in a
strange condition: The Beast [79] seemed much
abused, being bruised as if she had been running
over the Rocks, and marked where the Bridle
went, as if burnt with a red hot Bridle. Moreover,
one using a Pipe of Tobacco for the Cure
of the Beast, a blew Flame issued out of her, took
hold of her Hair, and not only spread and burnt
on her, but it also flew upwards towards the Roof
of the Barn, and had like to have set the Barn on
Fire: And the Mare dyed very suddenly.</p>

<p>IX. <i>Timothy Perley</i><a name="FNanchor_177_176" id="FNanchor_177_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_176" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> and his Wife, testify'd,
Not only unaccountable Mischiefs befel their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>Cattle, upon their having of Differences with this
Prisoner: but also that they had a Daughter destroyed
by Witchcrafts; which Daughter still
charged <i>How</i> as the Cause of her Affliction. And
it was noted, that she would be struck down
whenever <i>How</i> were spoken of. She was often
endeavoured to be thrown into the Fire, and into
the Water, in her strange Fits: Tho' her Father
had corrected her for charging <i>How</i> with bewitching
her, yet (as was testified by others also)
she said, She was sure of it, and must dye standing
to it. Accordingly she charged <i>How</i> to the
very Death; and said, <i>Tho'</i> How <i>could afflict and
torment her Body, yet she could not hurt her Soul:</i>
And, <i>That the Truth of this matter would appear
when she should be dead and gone</i>.</p>

<p>X. <i>Francis Lane</i><a name="FNanchor_178_177" id="FNanchor_178_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_177" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> testified, That being hired
by the Husband of this <i>How</i> to get him a parcel
of Posts and Rails, this Lane hired <i>John Pearly</i>
to assist him. This Prisoner then told <i>Lane</i>,
That she believed the Posts and Rails would
not do, because <i>John Perly</i> helped him; but
that if he had got them alone, without <i>John
Pearlie's</i> help, they might have done well enough.
When <i>James How</i> came to receive his Posts and
Rails of <i>Lane</i>, <i>How</i> taking them up by the Ends,
they, tho' good and sound, yet unaccountably
broke off, so that <i>Lane</i> was forced to get thirty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>or forty more. And this Prisoner being informed
of it, she said, She told him so before, because
<i>Pearly</i> helped about them.</p>

<p>XI. Afterwards there came in the Confessions
of several other (penitent) Witches, which affirmed
this <i>How</i> to be one of those, who with them
had been baptized by the Devil in the River at
<i>Newbury</i>-Falls: before which he made them
there kneel down by the Brink of the River and
worshiped him.</p>

<h3>V. <i>The Trial of</i> <span class="smcap">Martha Carrier</span>,<a name="FNanchor_179_178" id="FNanchor_179_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_178" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> <i>at the
Court of Oyer and Terminer, held by Adjournment
at Salem, August 2, 1692</i>.</h3>

<p>I. <span class="dropcapa">M</span><i>ARTHA CARRIER</i> was Indicted for
the bewitching of certain Persons, according
to the Form usual in such Cases, pleading
<i>Not Guilty</i>, [80] to her Indictment; there were
first brought in a considerable number of the bewitched
Persons; who not only made the Court
sensible of an horrid Witchcraft committed upon
them, but also deposed, That it was <i>Martha
Carrier</i>, or her Shape, that grievously tormented
them, by Biting, Pricking, Pinching and Choaking
of them. It was further deposed, That while
this <i>Carrier</i> was on her Examination, before the
Magistrates, the Poor People were so tortured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>that every one expected their Death upon the very
spot, but that upon the binding of <i>Carrier</i> they
were eased. Moreover the Look of <i>Carrier</i> then
laid the Afflicted People for dead; and her Touch,
if her Eye at the same time were off them, raised
them again: Which Things were also now seen
upon her Tryal. And it was testified, That upon
the mention of some having their Necks twisted
almost round, by the Shape of this <i>Carrier</i>, she
replyed, <i>Its no matter though their Necks had been
twisted quite off</i>.</p>

<p>II. Before the Trial of this Prisoner, several of
her own Children had frankly and fully confessed,
not only that they were Witches themselves, but
that this their Mother had made them so. This
Confession they made with great Shews of Repentance,
and with much Demonstration of
Truth. They related Place, Time, Occasion;
they gave an account of Journeys, Meetings and
Mischiefs by them performed, and were very
credible in what they said. Nevertheless, this
Evidence was not produced against the Prisoner
at the Bar, inasmuch as there was other Evidence
enough to proceed upon.</p>

<p>III. <i>Benjamin Abbot</i><a name="FNanchor_180_179" id="FNanchor_180_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_179" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> gave in his Testimony,
That last <i>March</i> was a twelvemonth, this <i>Carrier</i>
was very angry with him, upon laying out some
Land, near her Husband's: Her Expressions in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>this Anger, were, <i>That she would stick as close to
Abbot as the Bark stuck to the Tree; and that he
should repent of it afore seven Years came to an End,
so as Doctor</i> Prescot<a name="FNanchor_181_180" id="FNanchor_181_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_180" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> <i>should never cure him</i>. These
Words were heard by others besides <i>Abbot</i> himself;
who also heard her say, <i>She would hold his
Nose as close to the Grindstone as ever it was held
since his Name was</i> Abbot. Presently after this,
he was taken with a Swelling in his Foot, and
then with a Pain in his Side, and exceedingly
tormented. It bred into a Sore, which was
launced by Doctor <i>Prescot</i>, and several Gallons
of Corruption ran out of it. For six Weeks it
continued very bad, and then another Sore bred
in the Groin, which was also lanced by Doctor
<i>Prescot</i>. Another Sore then bred in his Groin,
which was likewise cut, and put him to very
great Misery: He was brought unto Death's
Door, and so remained until <i>Carrier</i> was taken,
and carried away by the Constable, from which
very Day he began to mend, and so grew better
every Day, and is well ever since.</p>

<p><i>Sarah Abbot</i> also, his Wife, testified, That her
Hus[41]band was not only all this while Afflicted
in his Body, but also that strange extraordinary
and unaccountable Calamities befel his Cattel;
their Death being such as they could guess at no
Natural Reason for.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Allin Toothaker</i><a name="FNanchor_182_181" id="FNanchor_182_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_181" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> testify'd, That <i>Richard</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>the son of <i>Martha Carrier</i>, having some difference
with him, pull'd him down by the Hair of
the Head. When he Rose again, he was going
to strike at <i>Richard Carrier;</i> but fell down flat
on his Back to the ground, and had not power to
stir hand or foot, until he told <i>Carrier</i> he yielded;
and then he saw the shape of <i>Martha Carrier</i>, go
off his breast.</p>

<p>This <i>Toothaker</i>, had Received a wound in the
<i>Wars;</i> and he now testify'd, that <i>Martha Carrier</i>
told him, He <i>should never be Cured</i>. Just
afore the Apprehending of <i>Carrier</i>, he could
thrust a knitting Needle into his wound, four
inches deep; but presently after her being siezed,
he was thoroughly healed.</p>

<p>He further testify'd, that when <i>Carrier</i> and he
sometimes were at variance, she would clap her
hands at him, and say, <i>He should get nothing by it;</i>
whereupon he several times lost his Cattle, by
strange Deaths, whereof no natural causes could
be given.</p>

<p>V. <i>John Rogger</i><a name="FNanchor_183_182" id="FNanchor_183_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_182" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> also testifyed, That upon the
threatning words of this malicious <i>Carrier</i>, his
Cattle would be strangely bewitched; as was more
particularly then described.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>
<p>VI. <i>Samuel Preston</i><a name="FNanchor_184_183" id="FNanchor_184_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_183" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> testify'd, that about two
years ago, having some difference with <i>Martha
Carrier</i>, he lost a <i>Cow</i> in a strange Preternatural
unusual manner; and about a month after this,
the said <i>Carrier</i>, having again some difference with
him, she told him; <i>He had lately lost a Cow, and
it should not be long before he lost another;</i> which
accordingly came to pass; for he had a thriving
and well-kept <i>Cow</i>, which without any known
cause quickly fell down and dy'd.</p>

<p>VII. <i>Phebe Chandler</i><a name="FNanchor_185_184" id="FNanchor_185_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_184" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> testify'd, that about a
Fortnight before the apprehension of <i>Martha
Carrier</i>, on a Lordsday, while the Psalm was
singing in the <i>Church</i>, this <i>Carrier</i> then took her
by the shoulder and shaking her, asked her, <i>where
she lived:</i> she made her no Answer, although as
<i>Carrier</i>, who lived next door to her Fathers House,
could not in reason but know who she was.
Quickly after this, as she was at several times
crossing the Fields, she heard a voice, that she
took to be <i>Martha Carriers</i>, and it seem'd as if
it [42] was over her head. The voice told her,
<i>she should within two or three days be poisoned</i>.
Accordingly, within such a little time, one half
of her right hand, became greatly swollen, and
very painful; as also part of her Face; whereof
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>she can give no account how it came. It continued
very bad for some dayes; and several times
since, she has had a great pain in her breast; and
been so siezed on her leggs, that she has hardly
been able to go. She added, that lately, going
well to the House of God, <i>Richard</i>, the son of
<i>Martha Carrier</i>, look'd very earnestly upon her,
and immediately her hand, which had formerly
been poisoned, as is abovesaid, began to pain her
greatly, and she had a strange Burning at her
stomach; but was then struck deaf, so that she
could not hear any of the prayer, or singing, till
the two or three last words of the Psalm.</p>

<p>VIII. One <i>Foster</i>,<a name="FNanchor_186_185" id="FNanchor_186_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_185" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> who confessed her own
share in the Witchcraft for which the Prisoner
stood indicted, affirm'd, that she had seen the
prisoner at some of their <i>Witch-meetings</i>, and
that it was this <i>Carrier</i>, who perswaded her to
be a Witch. She confessed, that the Devil carry'd
them on a pole, to a Witch-meeting; but
the pole broke, and she hanging about <i>Carriers</i>
neck, they both fell down, and she then received
an hurt by the Fall, whereof she was not at this
very time recovered.</p>

<p>IX. One <i>Lacy</i>,<a name="FNanchor_187_186" id="FNanchor_187_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_186" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> who likewise confessed her
share in this Witchcraft, now testify'd, that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>and the prisoner were once Bodily present at a
<i>Witch-meeting</i> in <i>Salem Village;</i> and that she
knew the prisoner to be a Witch, and to have
been at a Diabolical sacrament, and that the
prisoner was the undoing of her, and her Children,
by enticing them into the snare of the Devil.</p>

<p>X. Another <i>Lacy</i>, who also confessed her share
in this Witchcraft, now testify'd, that the prisoner
was at the <i>Witch-meeting</i>, in <i>Salem Village</i>, where
they had Bread and Wine Administred unto them.</p>

<p>XI. In the time of this prisoner's Trial, one
<i>Susanna Sheldon</i>,<a name="FNanchor_188_187" id="FNanchor_188_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_187" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> in open Court had her hands
Unaccountably ty'd together with a Wheel-band,
so fast that without cutting, it could not be loosed:
It was done by a <i>Spectre;</i> and the Sufferer affirm'd,
it was the <i>Prisoners</i>.</p>

<p><i>Memorandum.</i> This Rampant Hag, <i>Martha
Carrier</i>, was the [43] person, of whom the Confessions
of the Witches, and of her own Children
among the rest, agreed, That the Devil had promised
her, she should be <i>Queen of Hell</i>.<a name="FNanchor_189_188" id="FNanchor_189_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_188" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p class="p2 dropcap">HAVING thus far done the Service imposed
upon me; I will further pursue it, by relating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
a few of those Matchless <span class="smcap">Curiosities</span>, with
which the <i>Witchcraft</i> now upon us, has entertained
us. And I shall Report nothing but with
Good Authority, and what I would invite all my
Readers to examine, while 'tis yet Fresh and New,
that if there be found any mistake, it may be as
willingly <i>Retracted</i>, as it was unwillingly <i>Committed</i>.</p>

<h4><i>The First</i> <span class="smcap">Curiositie</span>.</h4>

<p>I. 'Tis very Remarkable to see what an Impious
and Impudent <i>imitation</i> of Divine Things, is
Apishly affected by the Devil, in several of those
matters, whereof the Confessions of our <i>Witches</i>,
and the Afflictions of our <i>Sufferers</i> have informed
us.</p>

<p>That Reverend and Excellent Person, Mr. <i>John
Higginson</i>, in my Conversation with him, Once
invited me to this Reflection; that the Indians
which came from far to settle about <i>Mexico</i>, were
in their Progress to that Settlement, under a Conduct
of the <i>Devil</i>, very strangely Emulating what
the Blessed God gave to <i>Israel</i> in the Wilderness.</p>

<p><i>Acosta</i>,<a name="FNanchor_190_189" id="FNanchor_190_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_189" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> is our Author for it, that the Devil in
'their Idol <i>Vitzlipultzli</i>,<a name="FNanchor_191_190" id="FNanchor_191_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_190" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> governed that mighty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>Nation. He commanded them to leave their
Country, promising to make them <i>Lords</i> over all
the Provinces possessed by <i>Six</i> other Nations of
Indians, and give them a Land abounding with
all precious things. They went forth, carrying
their Idol with them, in a Coffer of <i>Reeds</i>, supported
by Four of their Principal <i>Priests;</i> with
whom he still <i>Discoursed</i> in secret, Revealing to
them the Successes, and Accidents of their way.
He advised them, when to <i>March</i>, and where to
<i>Stay</i>, and without his Commandment they
moved not. The first thing they did, wherever
they came, was to Erect a <i>Tabernacle</i>, for their
false god; which they set always in the midst
of their Camp, and there placed the <i>Ark</i> upon
an <i>Alter</i>. When they, Tired with pains, talked
of, <i>proceeding no further</i> in their Journey, then a
certain pleasant Stage, whereto they were arrived,
this Devil in one night, horribly kill'd them
that [44] had started this Talk, by pulling out
their Hearts. And so they passed on till they
came to <i>Mexico.</i>'</p>

<p>The Devil which <i>then</i> thus imitated what was
in the Church of the <i>Old Testament</i>, now among
<i>Us</i> would Imitate the Affairs of the Church in
the <i>New</i>. The <i>Witches</i> do say, that they form
themselves much after the manner of <i>Congregational
Churches;</i> and that they have a <i>Baptism</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>and a <i>Supper</i>, and <i>Officers</i> among them, abominably
Resembling those of our Lord.<a name="FNanchor_192_191" id="FNanchor_192_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_191" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>But there are many more of these Bloody <i>Imitations</i>,
if the Confessions of the <i>Witches</i> are to be
Received; which I confess, ought to be but with
very much of Caution.</p>

<p>What is their stricking down with a fierce
<i>Look?</i> What is their making of the Afflicted <i>Rise</i>,
with a touch of their <i>Hand?</i> What is their
Transportation thro' the <i>Air?</i> What is their
Travelling <i>in Spirit</i>, while their Body is cast into
a Trance? What is their causing of <i>Cattle</i> to
run mad and perish? What is their Entring
their Names in a <i>Book?</i> What is their coming
together from all parts at the Sound of a <i>Trumpet?</i>
What is their Appearing sometimes Cloathed
with <i>Light</i> or <i>Fire</i> upon them? What is their
Covering of themselves and their Instruments
with <i>Invisibility?</i> But a Blasphemous Imitation
of certain Things recorded about our Saviour or
His Prophets, or the Saints in the Kingdom of
God.<a name="FNanchor_193_192" id="FNanchor_193_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_192" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>


<h4><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>

<i>A Second</i> <span class="smcap">Curiositie</span>.</h4>

<p>II. In all the <i>Witchcraft</i> which now Grievously
Vexes us, I know not whether anything be
more Unaccountable, than the Trick which the
Witches have to render themselves, and their
Tools <i>Invisible</i>. <i>Witchcraft</i> seems to be the Skill
of Applying the <i>Plastic Spirit</i> of the World, unto
some unlawful purposes, by means of a Confederacy
with <i>Evil Spirits</i>. Yet one would wonder
how the <i>Evil Spirits</i> themselves can do some
things: especially at <i>Invisibilizing</i> of the Grossest
Bodies. I can tell the Name of an Ancient
Author, who pretends to show the <i>way</i>, how a
man may come to walk about <i>Invisible</i>, and I can
tell the Name of another Ancient Author, who
pretends to Explode that way. But I will not
speak too plainly Lest I should unawares Poison
some of my <i>Readers</i>, as the pious <i>Hemingius</i><a name="FNanchor_194_193" id="FNanchor_194_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_193" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
did one of his <i>Pupils</i>, when he only by way of
Diversion recited a <i>Spell</i>, which, they had said,
would cure <i>Agues</i>. This much I will say; The
notion of procuring <i>Invisibility</i>, by any <i>Natural
Expedient</i>, yet known, is, I Believe, a meer <span class="smcap">Plinyism</span>;<a name="FNanchor_195_194" id="FNanchor_195_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_194" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
How far it may be [45] obtained by a
<i>Magical Sacrament</i>, is best known to the Dangerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Knaves that have try'd it. But our <i>Witches</i>
do seem to have got the knack: and this is one
of the Things, that make me think, <i>Witchcraft</i>
will not be fully understood, until the day when
there shall not be one Witch in the World.</p>

<p>There are certain people very <i>Dogmatical</i> about
these matters; but I'll give them only these three
Bones to pick.</p>

<p>First, One of our bewitched people, was cruelly
assaulted by a <i>Spectre</i>, that, she said, ran at her
with a <i>spindle:</i> tho' no body else in the Room,
could see either the <i>Spectre</i> or the <i>spindle</i>. At
last, in her miseries, giving a snatch at the <i>Spectre</i>,
she pull'd the <i>spindle</i> away, and it was no sooner
got into her hand, but the other people then present,
beheld, that it was indeed a Real, Proper,
Iron <i>spindle</i>, belonging they knew to whom;
which when they lock'd up very safe, it was
nevertheless by <i>Demons</i> unaccountably stole away,
to do further mischief.<a name="FNanchor_196_195" id="FNanchor_196_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_195" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>Secondly, Another of our bewitched people,
was haunted with a most abusive <i>Spectre</i>, which
came to her, she said, with a <i>sheet</i> about her.
After she had undergone a deal of Teaze, from
the Annoyance of the <i>Spectre</i>, she gave a violent
snatch at the sheet that was upon it; wherefrom
she tore a corner, which in her hand immediately
became <i>Visible</i> to a Roomful of Spectators; a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>palpable Corner of a Sheet. Her Father, who
was now holding her, catch'd that he might keep
what his Daughter had so strangely seized, but
the unseen <i>Spectre</i> had like to have pull'd his
hand off, by endeavouring to wrest it from him;
however he still held it, and I suppose has it still to
show; it being but a few hours ago, namely
about the beginning of this <i>October</i>, that this
Accident happened; in the family of one <i>Pitman</i>,<a name="FNanchor_197_196" id="FNanchor_197_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_196" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
at <i>Manchester</i>.</p>

<p>Thirdly, A young man, delaying to procure
Testimonials, for his Parents, who being under
confinement on suspicion of <i>Witchcraft</i>, required
him to do that service for them, was quickly
pursued with odd Inconveniences. But once
above the Rest, an Officer going to put his <i>Brand</i>
on the Horns of some <i>Cows</i>, belonging to these
people, which tho' he had seiz'd for some of their
debts, yet he was willing to leave in their possession,
for the subsistance of the poor Family;
this young man help'd in holding the Cows to be
thus branded. The three first <i>Cows</i> he held well
enough; but when the hot Brand was clap'd on
the Fourth, he <i>winc'd</i> and <i>shrunk</i> at such a Rate,
as that he could hold the Cow no longer. Being
afterwards Examined about it, he confessed, that
at that very instant when the <i>Brand</i> entered the
<i>Cow's Horn</i>, exactly the like [46] burning <i>Brand</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>was clap'd upon his own Thigh; where he has
exposed the lasting marks of it, unto such as asked
to see them.</p>

<p>Unriddle these Things,&mdash;<i>Et Eris mihi magnus
Apollo</i>.</p>


<h4><i>A Third</i> <span class="smcap">Curiositie</span>.</h4>

<p>III. If a Drop of <i>Innocent Blood</i> should be shed,
in the Prosecution of the <i>Witchcrafts</i> among us,
how unhappy are we! For which cause, I cannot
express my self in better terms than those of
a most Worthy Person, who lives near the present
Center of these things.<a name="FNanchor_198_197" id="FNanchor_198_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_197" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> <i>The Mind of</i> God
<i>in these matters, is to be carefully lookt into, with
due Circumspection, that Satan deceive us not with
his Devices, who transforms himself into an Angel
of Light, and may pretend justice and yet intend
mischief</i>. But on the other side, if the storm of
Justice do now fall only on the Heads of those
guilty <i>Witches</i> and <i>Wretches</i> which have defiled
our Land, <i>How Happy!</i></p>

<p>The Execution of some that have lately Dyed,
has been immediately attended, with a strange
Deliverance of some, that had lain for many
years, in a most sad Condition, under, they knew
not whose <i>evil hands</i>. As I am abundantly satisfy'd,
That many of the Self-Murders committed
here, have been the effects of a Cruel and Bloody
<i>Witchcraft</i>, letting fly <i>Demons</i> upon the miserable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span><i>Seneca's;</i> thus it has been admirable unto me to
see, how a Devilish <i>Witchcraft</i>, sending Devils
upon them, has driven many poor people to <i>Despair</i>,
and persecuted their minds, with such
Buzzes of <i>Atheism</i> and <i>Blasphemy</i>, as has made
them even run <i>distracted with Terrors:</i> And some
long <i>Bow'd</i> down under such a <i>spirit of Infirmity</i>,
have been marvellously Recovered upon the death
of the Witches.</p>

<p>One <i>Whetford</i><a name="FNanchor_199_198" id="FNanchor_199_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_198" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> particularly ten years ago,
challenging of <i>Bridget Bishop</i> (whose Trial you
have had) with steeling of a Spoon, <i>Bishop</i> threatned
her very direfully: presently after this, was
<i>Whetford</i> in the Night, and in her Bed, visited
by <i>Bishop</i>, with one <i>Parker</i>, who making the
Room light at their coming in, there discoursed
of several mischiefs they would inflict upon her.
At last they pull'd her out, and carried her unto
the Sea-side, there to <i>drown</i> her; but she calling
upon God, they left her, tho' not without Expressions
of their Fury. From that very time,
this poor <i>Whetford</i> was utterly spoilt, and grew a
Tempted, Froward, Crazed sort of a Woman; a
vexation to her self, and all about her; and many
ways unreasonable. In this Distraction she lay,
till those women were Apprehended by the Authority;
<i>then</i> she be[47]gan to mend; and upon
their Execution, was presently and perfectly Recovered,
from the ten years madness that had
been upon her.</p>
<h4><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>

<i>A Fourth</i> <span class="smcap">Curiositie</span>.</h4>

<p>IV. 'Tis a thousand pitties, that we should
permit our Eyes to be so <i>Blood-shot</i> with passions,
as to loose the sight of many wonderful things,
wherein the Wisdom and Justice of God, would
be Glorify'd. Some of those things, are the frequent
<span class="antiqua">Apparitions</span> of Ghosts, whereby many Old
<span class="antiqua">Murders</span> among us, come to be considered. And,
among many Instances of this kind, I will single
out one, which concerned a poor man, lately
<i>Prest</i> unto Death, because of his Refusing to
<i>Plead</i> for his Life.<a name="FNanchor_200_199" id="FNanchor_200_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_199" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> I shall make an Extract of
a Letter, which was written to my Honourable
Friend, <i>Samuel Sewal</i>, Esq.; by Mr. <i>Putman</i>, to
this purpose;</p>

<p>'The Last Night my Daughter <i>Ann</i>, was
grievously Tormented by Witches, Threatning
that she should be <i>Pressed</i> to Death, before <i>Giles
Cory</i>. But thro' the Goodness of a Gracious
God, she had at last a little Respite. Whereupon
there appeared unto her (she said) a man
in a Winding Sheet, who told her that <i>Giles
Cory</i> had Murdered him, by <i>Pressing</i> him to
Death with his Feet; but that the Devil there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>appeared unto him, and Covenanted with him,
and promised him, <i>He should not be Hanged</i>.
The Apparition said, God Hardned his heart;
that he should not hearken to the Advice of the
Court, and so Dy an easy Death; because as it
said, <i>It must be done to him as he has done to me</i>.
The Apparition also said, That <i>Giles Cory</i>, was
carry'd to the Court for this, and that the Jury
had found the Murder, and that her Father
knew the man, and the thing was done before
she was born. Now Sir, This is not a little
strange to us; that no body should Remember
these things, all the while that <i>Giles Cory</i> was in
Prison, and so often before the Court. For all
people now Remember very well, (and the Records
of the Court also mention it,) That about
Seventeen Years ago, <i>Giles Cory</i> kept a man in
his House, that was almost a Natural Fool:
which Man Dy'd suddenly. A Jury was impannel'd
upon him, among whom was Dr. <i>Zerobbabel
Endicot;</i><a name="FNanchor_201_200" id="FNanchor_201_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_200" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> who found the man bruised
to Death, and having clodders of Blood about
his Heart. The Jury whereof several are yet
alive brought in the man Murdered; but as if
some Enchantment had hindred the Prosecution
of the Matter, the Court Proceeded not against
[48] <i>Giles Cory</i>, tho' it cost him a great deal of
Mony to get off. Thus the Story,'</p>

<p class="dropcap">T<i>HE Reverend and Worthy Author, having at

that hath undergone such Diabolical
Molestations? No, there are other Good people,

I shall only single out a few of the
more Memorable passages therein Occurring; and
where it agrees with what happened among ourselves,
my Reader shall understand, by my inserting
a Word of every such thing in <span class="antiqua">Black Letter</span>.</p>

<p>I. It was in the Year 1669. and 1670. That at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span><i>Mohra</i> in <i>Sweedland</i>, the <span class="antiqua">Devils</span> by the help of
<span class="antiqua">Witches</span>, committed a most horrible outrage.
Among other Instances of Hellish Tyranny there
exercised, one was, that Hundreds of their
Children, were usually in the Night fetcht from
their Lodgings, to a Diabolical Rendezvouz, at a
place they called, <i>Blockula</i>, where the Monsters
that so Spirited them, <span class="antiqua">Tempted</span> them all manner
of Ways to <span class="antiqua">Associate</span> with them. Yea, such was
the perillous Growth of this <i>Witchcraft</i>, that Persons
of Quality began to send their Children into
other Countries to avoid it.</p>

<p>II. The Inhabitants had earnestly sought God
by <span class="antiqua">Prayer</span>; and <span class="antiqua">Yet</span> their Affliction <span class="antiqua">Continued</span>.
Whereupon <span class="antiqua">Judges</span> had a Special <span class="antiqua">Commission</span> to
find and root out the Hellish Crew; and the
rather, because another County in the Kingdom,
which had been so molested, was delivered upon
the Execution of the <i>Witches</i>.</p>

<p>III. The <span class="antiqua">Examination</span>, was begun with a Day of
<span class="antiqua">Humiliation</span>; appointed by Authority.<a name="FNanchor_203_202" id="FNanchor_203_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_202" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> Whereupon
the Commissioners <span class="antiqua">Consulting</span>, how they
might resist such a Dangerous Flood, the <span class="antiqua">Suffering
Children</span>, were first Examined; and tho' they
were [49] Questioned <span class="antiqua">One</span> by <span class="antiqua">One</span> apart, yet their
<span class="antiqua">Declarations All Agreed</span>. The <span class="antiqua">Witches</span> Accus'd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>in these Declarations, were then Examined; and
tho' at first they obstinately <span class="antiqua">Denied</span>, yet at length
many of them ingenuously <span class="antiqua">Confessed</span> the Truth of
what the children had said; owning with Tears,
that the <span class="antiqua">Devil</span>, whom they call'd <i>Loeyta</i>, had
stopt their <span class="antiqua">Mouths</span>; but he being now <span class="antiqua">Gone</span> from
them, they could <span class="antiqua">No Longer Conceal</span> the Business.
The things by them <span class="antiqua">Acknowledged</span>, most wonderfully
<span class="antiqua">Agreed</span> with what other Witches, in other
places had confessed.</p>

<p>IV. They confessed, that they did use to <span class="antiqua">Call
upon</span> the <span class="antiqua">Devil</span>, who thereupon would <span class="antiqua">Carry</span> them
away, over the Tops of Houses, to a Green
Meadow, where they gave themselves unto him.
Only one of them said, That sometimes the <i>Devil</i>
only took away her <span class="antiqua">Strength</span>, leaving her <span class="antiqua">Body</span> on
the ground; but she went at other times in <span class="antiqua">Body</span>
too.</p>

<p>V. Their manner was to come into the <span class="antiqua">Chambers</span>
of people, and fetch away their children upon
Beasts, of the Devils providing: promising <span class="antiqua">Fine
Clothes</span> and other Fine Things unto them, to inveagle
them. They said, they never had power
to do thus, till of late; but now the Devil did
<span class="antiqua">Plague</span> and <span class="antiqua">Beat</span> them, if they did not gratifie
him, in this piece of Mischief. They said, they
made use of all sorts of <span class="antiqua">Instruments</span> in their Journeys!
Of <span class="antiqua">Men</span>, of <span class="antiqua">Beasts</span>, of <span class="antiqua">Posts</span>; the <i>Men</i>
they commonly laid asleep at the place, whereto
they rode them; and if the children mentioned
the <span class="antiqua">Names</span> of them that stole them away, <b>they</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
were miserably <span class="antiqua">Scourged</span> for it, until some of them
were killed. The <span class="antiqua">Judges</span> found the marks of the
Lashes on some of them; but the Witches said,
<span class="antiqua">They would Quickly vanish</span>. Moreover the Children
would be in <span class="antiqua">Strange Fits</span>, after they were
brought Home from these Transportations.</p>

<p>VI. The <span class="antiqua">First Thing</span>, they said, they were to
do at <i>Blockula</i>, was to give themselves unto the
Devil, and <span class="antiqua">Vow</span> that they would serve him. Hereupon,
they <span class="antiqua">cut their Fingers</span>, and with <span class="antiqua">Blood</span> writ
their <span class="antiqua">Names</span> in his <span class="antiqua">Book</span>. And he also caused
them to be <span class="antiqua">Baptised</span> by such <span class="antiqua">Priests</span>, as he had, in
this Horrid company. In <span class="antiqua">some</span> of them, the
<span class="antiqua">Mark</span> of the <span class="antiqua">cut Finger</span> was to be found; they
said, that the Devil gave <span class="antiqua">Meat</span> and <span class="antiqua">Drink</span>, as to
<i>Them</i>, so to the Children they brought with
them: that afterwards their Custom was to <i>Dance</i>
before him; and <i>swear</i> and <i>curse</i> most horribly;
they said, that the Devil show'd them a great
Frightful, Cruel <i>Dragon</i>, telling them, <span class="antiqua">If they
confessed any Thing</span>, he would let loose that Great
Devil upon them; they added, that the Devil had
a <span class="antiqua">Church</span>, and that when the <span class="antiqua">Judges</span> were coming,
he told them <span class="antiqua">he would</span> [50] <span class="antiqua">kill them all</span>; and
that some of them had <span class="antiqua">Attempted to Murder the
Judges</span> but <span class="antiqua">could not</span>.</p>

<p>VII. Some of the <span class="antiqua">Children</span>, talked much of a
<span class="antiqua">White Angel</span>, which did use to <span class="antiqua">Forbid</span> them, what
the Devil had bid them to do, and <span class="antiqua">Assured</span> them
that these doings would <span class="antiqua">Not last long</span>; but that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
what had been done was permitted for the wickedness
of the People. This <span class="antiqua">White Angel</span>, would
sometimes rescue the Children, from <span class="antiqua">Going in</span>,
with the Witches.</p>

<p>VIII. The Witches confessed many mischiefs
done by them, declaring with what kind of
<span class="antiqua">Enchanted Tools</span>, they did their Mischiefs. They
sought especially to <span class="antiqua">kill the Minister</span> of <i>Elfdale</i>, but
could not. But some of them said, that such as
they wounded, would <span class="antiqua">Be recovered</span>, upon or before
their Execution.</p>

<p>IX. The <span class="antiqua">Judges</span> would fain have seen them
show some of their <span class="antiqua">Tricks</span>; but they Unanimously
declared, that, <span class="antiqua">Since they had confessed</span>, all, they
found all their <span class="antiqua">Witchcraft</span> gone; and the Devil
then <span class="antiqua">Appeared very Terrible</span> unto them, threatning
with an <span class="antiqua">Iron Fork</span>, to thrust them into a Burning
Pit, if they persisted in their Confession.</p>

<p>X. They were discovered no less than <i>three-score
and ten</i> Witches in One Village, <span class="antiqua">three and
twenty</span> of which <span class="antiqua">freely confessing</span> their Crimes,
were condemned to dy. The rest, (<span class="antiqua">One</span> pretending
she was with Child) were sent to <i>Fahluna</i>, where
most of them were afterwards executed. Fifteen
Children, which confessed themselves engaged in
this Witchery, dyed as the rest. Six and Thirty
of them between <i>nine</i> and <i>sixteen</i> years of Age,
who had been less guilty, were forced to run the
Gantlet, and be lashed on their hands once a
Week, for a year together; twenty more who
had less inclination to these Infernal enterprises,
were lashed with Rods upon their Hands for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
three Sundays together, at the Church door; the
number of the seduced Children, was about three
hundred. This course, together with <span class="antiqua">Prayers</span> in
all the Churches thro' the Kingdom, issued in the
deliverance of the Country.<a name="FNanchor_204_203" id="FNanchor_204_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_203" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>XI. The most Accomplished Dr. <i>Horneck</i> inserts
a most wise caution, in his preface to this
Narrative, saies he, <i>there is no Public Calamity, but
some ill people, will serve themselves of the sad providence
and make use of it for their own ends; as</i>
Thieves <i>when an house or town is on Fire, will steal
what they can</i>. And he mentions a Remarkable
Story of a young Woman, at <i>Stockholm</i>, in the
year 1676, Who accused her own Mother of being
a Witch; and swore positively, that she had
carried her away in the Night; the poor Woman
was burnt upon it: professing her innocency to
the last. But tho' she had been an Ill Woman,
yet it afterwards prov'd that she was not <i>such</i> an
one; for her Daughter came to the Judges [51]
with hideous Lamentations, Confessing, That she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>had wronged her Mother, out of a wicked spite
against her; whereupon the Judges gave order
for her Execution too.</p>

<p>But, so much of these things; and, now, <i>Lord,
make these Labours of thy Servant, Profitable to thy
People!</i></p>

<h3>THE DEVIL DISCOVERED.</h3>

<p class="center">2 Cor. II. ii. <i>We are not Ignorant of His</i> <span class="smcap">Devices</span>.</p>

<p class="dropcap">OUR Blessed Saviour has blessed us, with a
counsil, as Wholsome and as Needful as any
that can be given us, in Math. 26. 41. <i>Watch
and Pray, that yee Enter not into Temptation.</i> As
there is a Tempting <i>Flesh</i>, and a Tempting <i>World</i>,
which would seduce us from Our Obedience to
the Laws of God, so there is a Busy <i>Devil</i>, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>is by way of Eminency called, <i>The Tempter;</i> because
by him, the Temptations of the <i>Flesh</i> and
the <i>World</i> are managed.</p>

<p>It is not <i>One Devil</i> alone, that has Cunning or
Power enough to apply the Multitudes of <i>Temptations</i>,
whereby Mankind is daily diverted from
the Service of God; No, the <i>High Places</i> of Our
Air, are Swarming full of those <i>Wicked Spirits</i>,
whose Temptations trouble us; they are so many,
that it seems no less than a <i>Legion</i>, or more than
twelve thousands may be spared, for the Vexation
of one miserable man. But because those Apostate
Angels, are all <i>United</i> under one Infernal
Monarch, in the Designs of Mischief, 'tis in the
Singular Number, that they are spoken of. Now,
the <i>Devil</i> whose Malice and Envy, prompts him
to do what he can, that we may be as unhappy
as himself, do's ordinarily use more <i>Fraud</i> than
<i>Force</i>, in his assaulting of us; he that assail'd our
First Parents, in a <i>Serpent</i>, will still Act <i>Like a
Serpent</i>, rather than a <i>Lion</i>, in prosecuting of his
wicked purposes upon us, and for us to guard
against the Wiles of the <i>Wicked One</i>, is one of
the greatest cares, with which our God ha's
charged us.</p>

<p>We are all of us liable to various <i>Temptations</i>
every day, whereby if we are carried aside from
the strait <i>Paths of Righteousness</i>, we get all sorts
of wounds unto our selves. Of <i>Temptations</i>, I
may say, as the Wise Man said, of <i>Mortality;</i>
<i>there is no discharge from that war</i>. The <i>Devils</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
fell hard upon both <i>Adams</i>, nor may [52] any
among the Children of both, imagine to be excused.
The <i>Son</i> of God Himself, had this Dog
of Hell, barking at Him; and much more may
the Children of <i>Men</i>, look to be thus Visited;
indeed, there is hardly any <i>Temptation</i>, but what
is, <i>Common to Man</i>. When I was considering,
how to spend one Hour in Raising a most Effectual
and Profitable <i>Breastwork</i>, against the inroads
of this Enemy, I perceived it would be done, by
a short answer to this</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Case.</span></h3>

<p><i>What are those Usual Methods of</i> Temptation,
<i>with which the Powers of Darkness do assault the
Children of Men?</i></p>

<p>The <i>Corinthians</i>, having upon the Apostles
Direction, Excommunicated one of their Society,
who had married his Mother-in-law, &amp; this, as
it is thought, while his own Father was Living
too; the Apostle encourages them to Re-admit
that man, upon his very deep and sharp <i>Repentance</i>.
He gives divers Reasons of his propounding
this unto them; whereof one is, <i>Lest
Satan should get advantage of them;</i> for, had the
man miscarried, under any Rigour of the Sentence
continued upon him, after his <i>Repentance</i>,
'tis well if the Church itself had not quickly
fallen to pieces thereupon; besure, the Success of
the Gospel had been more than a little Incommoded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
The Apostle upon this Occasion, intimates,
That <i>Satan</i> has his <i>Devices;</i> by which
word are meant, Artifices or Contrivances used
for the <i>Deceiving</i> of those that are Treated with
them well, But what shall <i>we do</i> that we may
come to this <i>Corinthian Attainment, We are not
Ignorant of Satan's Devices?</i> [<i>Non cuivis homini
Contingit!</i>]</p>

<p>Truly, the Devil has <i>Mille Nocendi Artes;</i> and
it will be impossible for us, to run over all the
<i>Stratagems</i> and <i>Policies</i> of our Adversary. I shall
only attempt a few Observations upon the <i>Temptations</i>
of our Lord Jesus Christ: who was
<i>Tempted in all things like unto us, except in our Sins</i>.
When we read the <i>Temptations</i> of our Lord Jesus
Christ, in the Fourth Chapter of <i>Matthew</i> There,
Thence, you will understand, what was once
counted so difficult; Even, <i>The way of a Serpent
upon the Rock</i>. There are certain Ancient and
Famous <i>Methods</i> which the Devil in his <i>Temptations</i>,
does mostly accustome himself unto; which
is not so much from any Barrenness, or Sluggishness
in the Devil, but because he has had the
Encouragement of a, <i>Probatum est</i>, upon those
horrid Methods. How did the Devil assault the
First <i>Adam?</i> It was with Temptations drawn
from <i>Pleasure</i>, and <i>Profit</i>, and <i>Honour</i>, which, as
the Apostle notes, in 1 Joh. 2, 16. are, <i>All that
is in the World</i>. [53] With the very same temptations
it was, that he fell upon the Second <i>Adam</i>
too. Now, in those <i>Temptations</i>, you will see the
more <i>Usual Methods</i>, whereby the <i>Devil</i> would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
be Ensnaring of us; and I beseech you to attend
unto the following Admonitions, as those <i>Warnings</i>
of God, which the Lives of your souls depend
upon your taking of.</p>

<p>There were especially Three <i>Remarkable</i> Assaults
of <i>Temptations</i>, which the <i>Devil</i> it seems,
visibly made upon our Lord; after he had been
more invisibly for Forty dayes together <i>Tempting</i>
of that Holy One; and we may make a few distinct
<i>Remarks</i> upon them all.</p>

<p>§ The first of our Lords three Temptations is
thus related, in Mat. 4, 3. <i>He was an Hungry;
and when the Tempter came to him, he said, If thou
be the Son of God, Command that these Stones be
made Bread.</i></p>

<p>From whence, take these <i>Remarks</i>.</p>

<p>I. The Devil will ordinarily make our <i>Conditions</i>,
to be the Advantages of his <i>Temptations</i>.
When our Lord was <i>Hungry</i>, then <i>Bread! Bread!</i>
shall be all the Cry of his Temptation; the Devil
puts him upon a wrong step, for the getting of
<i>Bread</i>. There is no Condition, but what has indeed
some <i>Hunger</i> accompanying of it; and the
Devil marks what it is, that we are <i>Hungry</i> for.
One mans Condition makes him <i>Hunger</i> for Preferments,
or Employments, another mans makes
him <i>Hunger</i> for Cash or Land, or Trade; another
mans makes him <i>Hunger</i> for Merriments, or
Diversions: And the Condition of every Afflicted
Man, makes him <i>Hunger</i> with Impatience for
Deliverance. Now the Devil will be sure to suit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
his Perswasions with our <i>Conditions</i>. When he
has our <i>Condition</i> to speak with him, &amp; for him,
then thinks he, <i>I am sure this man will now hearken
to my Proposals!</i> Hence, if men are in <i>Prosperity</i>,
the Devil will tempt them to Forgetfulness of
God; if they are in <i>Adversity</i>, he will tempt
them to Murmuring at God; in all the expressions
of those impieties. Wise <i>Agur</i> was aware
of this; in <i>Prov.</i> 30, 9. says he, if a man be <i>Full</i>,
he shall be tempted, <i>to deny God, and say who is
the Lord?</i> if a man be Poor, he shall be tempted,
<i>to steal, and take the Name of God in vain</i>. The
Devil will talk suitably; if you ponder your
Conditions, you may expect you shall be tempted
agreeably thereunto.</p>

<p>II. The Devil does often manage his <i>temptations</i>,
by urging of our <i>Necessities</i>. Our Lord, was
thus by the Devil bawl'd upon; <i>You want Bread,
and you'll starve, if in my way you get it not</i>. The
Devil will show some forbidden thing unto us,
and plead concerning it, as of <i>Bread</i> we use to
say, <i>it must be had</i>. <i>Necessity</i> has a wonderful compulsion
in it. You may see what <i>Necessity</i> will
do, if you read in Deut. 28. 56. <i>the tender and the
delicate Woman among you, her eye shall be evil towards
the Children that she shall bear, for she shall
eat them for want of all things</i>. The Devil will
perswade us that there is a <i>Necessity</i> of our doing
what he does propound unto us; and then tho'
the <i>Laws</i> of God about us were so many <i>Walls</i>
of Stone, yet we shall break [54] through them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
all. That little inconvenience, of our coming to
beg our <i>Bread</i>, O what a fearful Representation
does the Devil make of it! and when once the
Devil scares us to think of a sinful thing, <i>it must
be done</i>, we soon come to think, <i>it may be done</i>.
When the Devil has frighted us into an Apprehension,
that it is a <i>Needful</i> thing which we are
prompted unto, he presently Engages all the Faculties
of our Souls, to prove, that it may be a
<i>Lawful</i> one; the Devil told <i>Esau, You'll dye if
you don't sell your Birthright;</i> the Devil told
<i>Aaron, You'll pull all the people about your ears, if
you do not countenance their superstitions;</i> and then
they comply'd immediately. Yea, sometimes if
the Devil do but Feign a Necessity, he does
thereby <i>Gain</i> the Hearts of Men; he did but
feign a Need, when he told <i>Saul, the Cattel must
be spared, and the sacrifice must be precipitated</i>, and
he does but feign a Need, when he tells many a
man, <i>if you do no servile work on the Sabbath-day,
and if you don't Rob God of his evening</i>,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> <i>you'll
never subsist in the world</i>. All the denials of God,
in the world, use to be from this Fallacy impos'd
upon us. It never can be necessary for us to violate
any Negative Commandment in the Law of
our God; where God says, <i>thou shalt not</i>, we cannot
upon any pretence reply, I <i>must</i>. But the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>Devil will put a most formidable and astonishing
face of necessity upon many of those <i>Abominable
things, which are hateful to the soul of God</i>. He'll
say nothing to us about, the one thing needful;
but the petite and the sorry <i>Need-nots</i> of this
world, he'll set off with most bloody Colours of
<i>Necessity</i>. He will not say, <i>'tis necessary for you to
maintain the Favour of your God, and secure the</i>
welfare of your Soul; but he'll say, <i>'tis necessary
for you to keep in with your Neighbours; and that
you and yours may have a good Living among them</i>.</p>

<p>III. The Devil does insinuate his most Horrible
<i>Temptations</i>, with pretence, of much <i>Friendship</i>
and <i>Kindness</i> for us. He seemed very unwilling
that our Lord should want any thing that might
be comfortable for him; but, he was a <i>Devil</i> still!
The <i>Devil</i> flatters our Mother Eve, as if he was
desirous to make her more Happy than her
Maker did; but there was the <i>Devil</i> in that
flattery. <i>Sub Amici fallere Nomen</i>,&mdash;&mdash;to Salute
men with profers to do all manner of Service for
them; and at the same time to Stab them as
<i>Joab</i> did <i>Abner</i> of old; this is just like the <i>Devil</i>,
and the <i>Devil</i> truly has many Children that Imitate
him in it. Some very Affectionate Things
were spoken once unto our Lord; <i>Lord, be it far
from thee, that thou shouldest suffer any Trouble!</i>
But our Lords Answer was, in Mat. 16. 23. <i>Get
thee behind me Satan.</i> The Devil will say to a
man, <i>I would have thee to Consult thy own Interest,
and I would have Trouble to be far from thee</i>. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
speaks these <i>Fair Things</i>, by the Mouths of our
professed Friends unto us, as he did by the Tongue
of a Speckled Snake unto our Deluded Parents at
the first. But all this while, 'tis a Direction that
has been wisely given us; <i>When he speaks fair,
Believe him not, for there are seven Abominations in
his Heart</i>.</p>

<p>IV. Things in themselves <i>Allowable</i> and <i>Convenient</i>,
are oftentimes turned into sore <i>Temptations</i>
by the Devil. He press'd our Lord unto the
mak[55]ing of <i>Bread;</i> Why, that very thing
was afterwards done by our Lord, in the Miracles
of the <i>Loaves;</i> and yet it is now a motion of the
<i>Devil, Pray, make thy self a little Bread</i>. The
Devil will frequently put men by, from the doing
of a <i>seasonable Duty;</i> but how? Truly by putting
us upon another <i>Duty</i>, which may be at that juncture
a most <i>Unseasonable</i> Thing. It is said in
Eccl. 8. 5. <i>A Wise Mans heart discerns both Time
and Judgment.</i> The <i>Ill-Timing</i> of good Things,
is One of the chief Intregues, which the Devil
has to Prosecute. The Devil himself, will Egg
us on to many a <i>Duty;</i> and why so? But because
at that very Time a more proper and Useful
Duty, will have a <i>Supersedeas</i> given thereunto.
And, thus there are many Things, whereof we
can say, though no more than this, yet so much
as this, <i>They are Lawful ones</i>, by which Lawful
Things&mdash;&mdash;<i>Perimus Omnes</i>. Where shall we find
that the Devil has laid our most fatal Snares?
Truly, our Snares are on the <i>Bed</i>, where it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
<i>Lawful</i> for us to Sleep; at the <i>Board</i>, where it is
<i>Lawful</i> for us to Sit; in the <i>Cup</i>, where 'tis
<i>Lawful</i> to Drink; and in the <i>Shops</i>, where we
have <i>Lawful</i> Business to do. The <i>Devil</i> will decoy
us, unto the utmost Edge of the <i>Liberty</i> that
is <i>Lawful</i> for us; and then one Little push, hurries
us into a Transgression against the Lord. And
the <i>Devil</i> by Inviting us to a <i>Lawful</i> thing, at a
wrong time for it, Layes us under further Entanglement
of Guilt before God. 'Tis <i>Lawful</i> for
People to use Recreations; but in the Evening
of the Lords Day, or the Morning of any Day,
how Ensnaring are they! The <i>Devil</i> then too
commonly bears part in the Sport. If <i>Promiscuous
Dancing</i> were Lawful; though almost all the
Christian Churches in the World, have made a
Scandal of it; yet for Persons to go presently
from a <i>Sermon</i> to a <i>Dance</i>, is to do a thing, which
Doubtless the <i>Devil</i> makes good Earnings of.</p>

<p>V. To <i>distrust</i> Gods Providence and Protection,
is one of the worst things, into which the Devil
by his <i>Temptations</i> would be hurrying of us. He
would fain have driven our Lord unto a Suspicion
of Gods care about Him, said the Devil, <i>You may
dy for lack of Bread, if you do not look better after
your self, than God is like to do for you</i>. It is an
usual thing for Persons to dispair of Gods <i>Fatherly
Care</i> Concerning them; they torture themselves
with distracting and amazing Fears, that they
shall come to want before they dy; Yea, they
even say with <i>Jonas</i>, in Chap. 2. 4. <i>I am cast out</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
<i>of the sight of God;</i> He wont look after me! But
it is the Devil that is the Author of all such
Melancholly Suggestions in the minds of men.
It is a thought that often raises a Feaver in the
Hearts of <i>Married</i> Persons, when Charges grow
upon them; <i>God will never be able in the way of
my calling, to feed and cloath all my Little Folks</i>.
It is a Thought with which <i>Aged</i> persons are
often tormented, <i>Tho' God has all my dayes hitherto
supplied me, yet I shall be pinched with Straits
before I come to my Journeys end</i>. 'Tis a malicious
Devil that raises these <i>Evil surmisings</i> in the hearts
of Men. And sometimes a distemper of Body
affords a Lodg[56]ing for the Devil, from whence
he shoots the cruel Bombs of such <i>Fiery Thoughts</i>
into the minds of many other persons. With
such thoughts does the Devil choose to persecute
us; because thereby we come to <i>Forfeit</i> what we
<i>Question</i>. We <i>Question</i> the Care of God, and so
we <i>Forfeit</i> it, until perhaps the Devil do utterly
<i>drown us in Perdition</i>. Our God says, <i>Trust in
the Lord, and do good, and verily thou shalt be fed</i>.
But the Devil says, <i>don't you trust in God; be
afraid that you shall not be fed;</i> and thus he hinders
men from the <i>doing of Good</i>.</p>

<p>VI. There is nothing more Frequent in the
<i>Temptations</i> of the Devil, then for our <i>Adoption</i>
to be doubted, because of our <i>Affliction</i>. When
our Lord was in his Penury, then says the Devil,
<i>If thou be the Son of God;</i> he now makes an <i>If</i>,
of it; <i>What? the Son of God, and yet not be able to</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
<i>Command a Bit of Bread!</i> Thus, when we are in
very Afflictive Circumstances, this will be the
Devils Inference, <i>Thou art not a Child of God</i>.
The Bible says in Heb. 12. 7. <i>If you are Chastened,
it is a shrow'd sign that you can't be Children.</i>
Since he can't Rob us of our <i>Grace</i>, he would
Rob us of our <i>Joy;</i> and therefore having Accused
us unto God, he then Accuses God unto
us. When <i>Israel</i> was weak and faint in the Wilderness,
then did <i>Amalek</i> set upon them; just so
does the Devil set upon the people of God, when
their Losses, their Crosses, their Exercises have
Enfeebled their Souls within them; and what
says the Devil? E'en the same that was mutter'd
in the Ear of the Afflicted <i>Job, Is not this the
Uprightness of thy Ways? Remember, I pray thee,
who ever perished, being Innocent? If thou wert a
Child of God, He would never follow thee, with such
Testimonies of his Indignation</i>. This is the <i>Logic</i>
of the Devil; and he thus interrupts that patience
and that Chearfulness wherewith we should <i>suffer
the will of God</i>.</p>

<p>VII. To dispute the Divine Original and Authority
of <i>Gods Word</i>, is not the least of those
<i>Temptations</i> with which the Devil troubles us.
God from Heaven, had newly said unto our Lord,
<i>this is my Beloved Son;</i> but now the Devil would
have him to make a dispute of it, <i>If thou be the
son of God</i>. The Devil durst not be so Impudent,
and Brasen fac'd, as to bid men use <i>Pharaohs</i>
Language, <i>Who is the Lord, that I should obey his</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
<i>voice?</i> But he will whisper into our Ears, what
he did unto our Mother <i>Eve</i> of old, <i>It is not the
Lord that hath spoken what you call his Word</i>.
The Devil would have men say unto the <i>Scripture</i>,
what they said unto the <i>Prophet</i>, in Jer. 43.
2. <i>Thou speakest falsely; the Lord our God hath
not sent thee to speak what thou sayest unto us;</i> &amp;
he would fain have secret &amp; cursed Misgivings in
our hearts, <i>that things are not altogether so as the
Scripture has represented them</i>. The Devil would
with all his heart make one huge Bonefire of all
the Bibles in the world; &amp; he has got Millions
of persecutors to <i>assist him in the suppression of that
miraculous book. It was the devil once in the
tongue of a Papist</i>, that cry'd out, <i>A plague on this
bible; this 'tis that</i> [89] <i>does all our mischief</i>. But
because he can't <i>Suppress</i> this Book, he sets himself,
to <i>Disgrace</i> it all that he can. Altho' the
Scripture carries its <i>own Evidence</i> with it, and be
all over, so pure, so great, so true, and so powerful,
that it is impossible it should proceed from any
but God alone; yet the Devil would gladly bring
some Discredit upon it, as if it were but some
<i>Humane Contrivance;</i> Of nothing, is the Devil
more desirous, than this; That we should not
count, <i>Christ</i> so precious, <i>Heaven</i> so Glorious,
<i>Hell</i> so Dreadful, and <i>Sin</i> so odious, as the Scripture
has declared it.</p>

<p>§. The Second of our Lords Three Temptations,
is related after this manner, in Mat. 4. 5, 6.
<i>Then the Devil taketh him up, into the Holy City,</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
<i>and setteth him upon a Pinacle of the Temple; and
saith unto him, if thou be the Son of God, cast thy
self down; for it is written, He shall give his Angels
charge concerning thee, and in their Hands, they
shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy Foot
against a Stone</i>.</p>

<p>From whence take these <i>Remarks</i>.</p>

<p>I. The places of the greatest <i>Holiness</i> will not
secure us from Annoyance by the <i>Temptations</i> of
the Devil, to the greatest wickedness. When our
Lord was in the <i>Holy City</i>, the Devil fell upon
him there. Indeed, there is now no proper <i>Holiness</i>
of <i>Places</i> in our Days; the Signs and Means
of Gods more special Presence are not under the
Gospel, ty'd unto any certain <i>places:</i> Nevertheless
there are <i>places</i>, where we use to enjoy much of
God; and where, altho' God visit not the <i>Persons</i>
for the sake of the <i>Places</i>, yet he visits the <i>Places</i>
for the sake of the <i>Persons</i>. But, I am to tell
you that the Devil will visit those <i>Places</i> and best
<i>Persons</i> there. No <i>Place</i>, that I know of, has
got such a <i>Spell</i> upon it, as will always keep the
Devil out. The <i>Meeting-House</i> wherein we Assemble
for the Worship of God, is fill'd with
many Holy People, and many Holy Concerns
continually; but if our Eyes were so refined as
the Servant of the Prophet had his of old, I suppose
we should now see a Throng of <i>Devils</i> in
this very place. The Apostle has intimated, that
Angels come in among us; there are Angels it
seems that hark, how I <i>Preach</i>, and how you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
<i>Hear</i>, at this Hour. And our own sad Experience
is enough to intimate, That the <i>Devils</i> are
likewise Rendevouzing here. It is Reported, in
<i>Job</i> 1. 5. <i>When the Sons of God came to present
themselves before the Lord, Satan came also among
them.</i> When we are in our Church-Assemblies,
O how many <i>Devils</i>, do you imagine, [90] croud
in among us! There is a <i>Devil</i> that rocques one
to Sleep, there is a <i>Devil</i> that makes another to be
thinking of, he scarce knows what himself; and
there is a <i>Devil</i>, that makes another, to be pleasing
himself with wanton and wicked Speculations.
It is also possible, that we have our <i>Closets</i>, or our
<i>Studies</i>, gloriously perfumed with Devotions every
day; but alas, can we shut the Devil out of them?
No, Let us go where we will, we shall still find
a Devil nigh unto us. Onely, when we come to
Heaven, we shall be out of his reach for ever; <i>O
thou foul Devil; we are going where thou canst not
come!</i> He was hissed out of <i>Paradese</i>, and shall
never enter it any more. Yea, more than so,
when the <i>New Jerusalem</i> comes down into the
<i>High Places</i> of our Air, from whence the Devil
shall then be banished, there shall be no Devil
within the Walls of that Holy City. <i>Amen.
Even so Lord Jesus, Come quickly.</i></p>

<p>II. Any other acknowledgments of the Lord
Jesus Christ, will be permitted by the Temptations
of the Devil, provided those Acknowledgments of
him, which are <i>True</i> and <i>Full</i>, may be thereby
prevented. What was it, that the Devil hurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
our Lord Jesus Christ unto the Top of the <i>Temple</i>
for? Surely it could not meerly be to find
<i>Precipices;</i> any part of the Wilderness would
have afforded <i>Them</i>. No, it was rather to have
<i>Spectators</i>. And why so, Why, the carnal Jews
had an Expectation among them; that <i>Elias</i> was
to fly from Heaven to the Temple; and the Devil
seems willing, that our Lord should be cry'd up
for <i>Elias</i>, among the giddy multitude; or any
thing in the World, tho never so considerable
otherwise, rather than to be received as the Christ
of God. The Devil will allow his Followers to
think very highly of the Lord Jesus Christ; O
but he is very lothe to have them think, <i>All</i>.
We read in Col. 1. 19. <i>It has pleased the Father,
that in him there should all Fullness dwell.</i> But it
is pleasing to the Devil that we deny something
of the Immense <i>Fullness</i>, which is in our Lord.
The Devil would confess to our Lord, <i>Thou art
the Holy one of God!</i> but then he claps in, <i>Thou
art Jesus of Nazareth;</i> which was to conceal our
Lords being <i>Jesus of Bethlehem</i>, and so his being,
<i>The True Messiah</i>. All the <i>Heresies</i>, and all the
Persecutions, that ever plagued the Church of
God, have still been, to strike at some <i>Glory</i> of
our Lord Jesus Christ. A <span class="smcap">Christ</span> Entirely Acknowledged,
will save the Souls of them that so
Acknowledge Him; but, says the Devil, <i>Whatever
I must not give way to that</i>. As they say,
the Devil [91] makes Witches unable to utter
all the <i>Lords Prayer</i>, or some such System of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Religion, without some Deprevations of it; thus
the Devil will consent that we may make a very
large Confession of the Lord Jesus Christ; only
he will have us to deprave it, at least in some one
Important Article. Some one Honour, some one
Office, and some one <i>Ordinance</i> of the Lord Jesus
Christ, must be always left unacknowledged, by
those that will do as the Devil would have them.</p>

<p>III. <i>High Stations</i> in the Church of God, lay
men open to violent and peculiar <i>Temptations</i> of
the Devil. When our Lord was upon the <i>Pinacle</i>,
that is not the <i>Fane</i>, or <i>Spire</i>, but the <i>Battlements</i>
of the <i>Temple</i>, there did the Devil pester him,
with singular Molestations, and he therein seems
to intend an Entanglement for the Jews, as well
as for our Lord. Believe me they that stand
High, cannot stand safe. The Devil is a <i>Nimrod</i>,
a mighty Hunter; and common or little Game,
will not serve his Turn: he is a <i>Leviathan</i>, of
whom we may say, as in <i>Job.</i> 41. 34. <i>He beholds
all high things.</i> Men of high Attainments, and
Men of high Employments, in the Church of
God, must look, like <i>Peter</i> to be more <i>Sifted</i>,
and like <i>Paul</i>, to be more <i>Buffeted</i> than other
Men. <i>Feriunt Summos Fulmina Montes.</i>&mdash;&mdash;The
Devil can raise a Storm, when God permitteth it,
but as for those Men that stand near Heaven, the
Devil will attack them with his most cruel storms
of Thunder and Lightening. It was said, <i>let him
that stands take heed;</i> but we may say, <i>They that
stand most high, have cause to take most heed</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Devil is a <i>Goliah;</i> and when he finds a <i>Champion</i>,
he'l be sure most fiercely to Combate such a Man.
He is for, <i>Killing many Birds with one stone;</i> and
he knows that he shall hinder a world of <i>Good</i>,
and produce a world of <i>Ill</i>, if once he can
bring a Man Eminently Stationed into his Toyls.
Hence 'tis that the <i>Ministers</i> of God, are more
dogg'd by the Devil, than other persons are.
Especially such <i>Ministers</i>, as move in the highest
Orb of Serviceableness; and most of all such
<i>Ministers</i> as have spent many years in Laudable
Endeavours to be serviceable; Those Ministers
are the <i>Stars</i> of Heaven, at which the <i>Tayl</i> of the
<i>Dragon</i>, will give the most sweeping and most
stinging strokes; the Devil will find that for
them, that shall make them <i>Walk softly</i> all their
Days. These are the Men, that have creepled,
and vexed the Devil more than other Men; for
which the Devil has an old Quarrel with them.
O Neighbours, little do you think, what black
Days of Mourning, and Fasting, and Praying
before the Lord, a Raging Devil does fill the
lives of such <i>Men of God</i> withall.</p>

<p>[92] IV. The Devil will make a deceitful and
unfaithful use of the <i>Scriptures</i> to make his <i>Temptations</i>
forceable. When the Devil Solicited our
Lord, unto an evil thing, he quoted the <i>Ninty
First</i> Psalm unto him, tho' indeed he fallaciously
clip'd it, and maim'd it, of one clause very material
in it. O never does the Devil make such
dangerous Passes at us, as when he does wrest our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
own <i>Sword</i> out of our Hands, and push <i>That</i> upon
us. We have to defend us, that Weapon in <i>Eph.</i> 6.
16. <i>The Sword of the Spirit, which is the word of
God;</i> but when the Devil has that very Weapon
to fight us with, he makes terrible work of it.
When the Devil would poyson men with false
<i>Doctrines</i>, he'l quote Scriptures for them; a <i>Quaker</i>
himself, will have the First Chapter of <i>John</i>
always in his mouth. When the Devil would
perswade men to vile <i>Actions</i>, he'l quote Scriptures
for them; he'l encourage men to go on in Sin,
by showing them, where 'tis said, <i>The Lord is
ready to Pardon</i>. I say this, The one story of
<i>Davids</i> Fall, in the Scripture, has been made by
the Devil an Engine for the Damnation of many
Millions. The Devil will fright men from doing
those things, that are, <i>the Things of their Peace;</i>
but How? He'l turn a <i>Scripture</i> into a <i>Scarecrow</i>
for them. The Devil will fright them from
all constant Prayer to God, by quoting that Scripture,
<i>The Sacrifice of the Wicked, is an Abomination
to the Lord;</i> the Devil will fright them from the
Holy Supper of God, by quoting that Scripture,
<i>He that Eats and Drinks unworthily, Eats and
Drinks damnation to himself</i>. And thus the Devil
will by some abused Scripture, Terrifie the Children
of God; the Scripture is written as we are
told, <i>For our Comfort;</i> but it is quoted by the
Devil, <i>for our terror</i>. How many Godly Souls
have been cast into sinful Doubts and Fears, by
the Devils foolish glosses upon that Scripture, <i>He</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
<i>that doubts is damned;</i> and that, <i>the fearful shall
have their portion in the burning Lake:</i> The Devil
sometimes has play'd the <i>Preacher</i>, but I say,
<i>Beware all silly Souls when such a Fool is Preaching</i>.</p>

<p>V. Grievous and Pulling Hurries to <i>Self-Murder</i>
are none of the smallest outrages, which the
Devil in his <i>Temptations</i> commits upon us. Why,
did the Devil say to our Lord, <i>Cast thy self down</i>,
but in hopes that our Lord would have broke his
Bones, in the fall? The Devil is an <i>Old Murtherer;</i>
and he loves to <i>Murder</i> men; but no
<i>Murder</i> gives him so much satisfaction, as that
which at his instigation, men perpetrate upon
themselves. We [93] see that such as are <i>Bewitched</i>
and <i>Possessed</i> by the Devil, do quickly lay
violent hands upon themselves, if they be not
watched continually, and we see that when persons
have begun that <i>Unnatural</i> business of <i>killing
themselves</i>, there is a <i>Preternatural</i> Stupendious
Prodigious Assistance, by the Devil given thereunto.
When people are going to Harm themselves,
we call upon them, like those to the Jailor,
in <i>Acts</i> 16. 28. <i>Do thy self no harm!</i> And we
have this Argument for it, <i>It is the Devil that is
dragging of you to this mischief; but will you believe,
will you obey such an one as the Devil is?</i>
What was it that made Judas to strangle himself?
We read it was when the <i>Devil was in him</i>. I
suppose there are few <i>self-murderers</i>, but what are
first very strangely fallen into the Devils hands;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
and possibly, 'tis by some Extraordinary <i>Discontent</i>,
against God, or <i>back-sliding</i> from him, that
the Devil first entred into those disturbed Souls.
Indeed, some very great Saints of God, have
sometimes had hideous Royls raised by the Devil
in their minds; untill they have e'en cry'd out
with <i>Job, I choose strangling rather than life;</i> and
sometimes the ill Humours or Vapours in the
Bodies of such Good Men, do so harbour the
Devil that they have this woful motion every day
thence made unto them; <i>You must kill your self!
you must! you must!</i> But it is rarely any other
than a <i>Saul</i>, an <i>Abimelek</i>, an <i>Achitophel</i>, or a
<i>Judas;</i> rarely any other, than a very Reprobate,
whom the Devil can drive, while the man is
<i>Compos Mentis</i>, to Consummate such a Villany.
Yea, no Child of God, in his Right Senses can
go so far in this impiety, as to be left without all
Time and Room for true <i>Repentance</i> of the
Crime; 'tis <i>thus</i> done, by none but those that go
to the Devil. A <i>self-murder</i>, acted by one that
is upon other accounts a Reasonable man, is but
such an attempt of Revenge upon the God that
made him, as none but one full of the Devil can
be guilty of. If any of you are Dragoon'd by
the Devil, unto the murdering of your selves, my
Advice to you is, <i>Disclose it, Reveal it, make it
known immediately</i>. One that Cut his own Throat
among us, Expired crying out, <i>O that I had told!
O that I had told</i>. You may spoil the Devil, if
you'l <i>Tell</i> what he is a doing of.</p>

<p>VI. Presumptuous and Unwarrantable <i>Trials of</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
the Blessed God, are some of those things whereinto
the Devil would fain hook us with his <i>Temptations</i>.
This was that which the Devil would
have brought our Lord unto, even, <i>A tempting of
the Lord our God</i>. It is the charge of our God
upon us, in <i>Deut.</i> 6. 16. <i>Thou shalt not tempt the
Lord thy God.</i> But that which the Devil <i>Tries</i>,
is, to put us upon <i>Trying</i> in a sinful way whether
God be such a God as indeed he is. [94] 'Tis
true as to the ways of Obedience, our God says
unto us, <i>Prove me, in those ways; Try, whether I
won't be as good as my Word</i>. But then there are
ways of <i>Presumption</i>, wherein the Devil would
have us to trie, what a God it is, <i>With whom we
have to do</i>. The Devil would have us to trie the
Purpose of God, about our selves or others; but
how? By going to the <i>Devil</i> himself; by Consulting
<i>Astrologers</i>, or <i>Fortune Tellers;</i> or perhaps
by letting the Bible fall open, to see what is the
first Sentence we light upon. The Devil would
have us trie the Mercy of God, but how? By
running into <i>Dangers</i>, which we have no call
unto. He would have us trie the Power of God;
but how? By looking for good things, without
the use of Means for the getting of them. He
would have us trie the Justice of God; but how?
By venturing upon Sin in a <i>Corner</i>, with an Imagination
that God will never bring us out. He
would have us trie the Promise of God; but how?
By <i>Limiting</i> the Lord, unto such or such a way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
of manifesting Himself, or else believing of nothing
at all. He would have us trie the Threatning
of God; but how? By going on impenitently
in those things, for which the <i>Wrath of
God comes upon the Children of Disobedience</i>. Thus
would the Devil have us to affront the Majesty
of Heaven every day.</p>

<p>VII. The <i>Temptations</i> of the Devil, aim at
puffing and bloating of us up, with <i>Pride;</i> as
much perhaps as any one iniquity. The Devil
would have had Our Lord make a <i>Vain glorious</i>
Discovery of himself unto the World, by <i>Flying
in the air</i>, so as no mortal can. <i>Hoc Ithacus velit</i>&mdash;the
Devil would have us to soar aloft, and not
only to be above other men, but also to <i>know</i> that
we are so, <i>Pride</i> is the Devils own sin; and he
affects especially to be, <i>The King over the Children
of Pride</i>, it is a caution in 1 Tim. 3. 6. A Pastor
must not be <i>A Novice; Lest being lifted up with
Pride, He fall into the condemnation of the Devil.
(Summo ac Pio cum Tremore Hunc Textum Legamus
nos Ministri Juvenes!)</i> Accordingly, the
Devil would have us to be inordinately taken and
moved with what <i>Excellencies</i> our God has bestowed
upon us. If our <i>Estates</i> rise, he would
have us rise in our Spirits too. If we have been
blessed with Beauty, with Breeding, with Honour,
with Success, with Attire, with Spiritual
Priviledges, or with Praise-worthy Performances;
Now says the Devil, <i>Think thy self better than
other Men</i>. Yea, the Devil would have us arrogate
unto our selves, those <i>Excellencies</i> which really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
we never were owners of; and <i>Boast of a false
Gift</i>. He would have us moreover to Thirst
after Applause among others that may see Our
<i>Excellencies!</i> and be impatient if we are not
accounted <i>some-body</i>. He would have us further[95]more,
to aspire after such a <i>Figure</i>, as
God has never yet seen fitting for us; and croud
into some <i>High Chair</i> that becomes us not. Thus
would the Devil Elevate us into the <i>Air</i>, above
our Neighbours; and why so? 'Tis that we may
be punished with such <i>Falls</i>, as may make us cry
out with <i>David, O my Bones are broken with my
Falls!</i> The Devil can't endure to see men lying
in the <i>Dust;</i> because there is no falling thence.
He is a <i>Fallen Spirit</i> himself, and it pleases him
to see the <i>Falls</i> of men.</p>

<p>§. The Third of our Lords Three Temptations,
is related in such Terms as these. Matth.
4. 8, 9. <i>Again the Devil taketh him up, into an
exceeding High Mountain, and sheweth him all the
Kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them: and
saith unto him, all these things will I give thee, if
thou wilt fall down and Worship me.</i> From whence
take these Remarks.</p>

<p>I. The Devil in his <i>Temptations</i> will set the
Delight of this world before us; but he'll set a
fair, and a false <i>Varnish</i> upon those Delights.
They were some unknown <i>Perspectives</i>, which
the Devil had, both for the Refracting of the
<i>Medium</i>, and for the Magnifying of the <i>Object</i>,
whereby he gave our Lord at once a prospect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
the whole Roman Empire; but what was it? It
was the <i>World</i>, and the <i>Glory</i> of it; he says not
a word of the <i>World</i>, and the <i>Trouble</i> of it. No
sure; not a word of that; the Devil will not
have his Hook so barely expos'd unto us. The
Devil sets off the Delights of Sin, which he offers
unto us, with a stretched and raised Rhetorick;
but he will not own, <i>That in the midst of our
Laughter, our Heart shall be sorrowful;</i> and <i>That
the end of our Mirth shall be Heaviness</i>. There is
but one Glass in the Spectacles, with which the
Devil would have us to read, those passages in
<i>Eccles.</i> 11. 9. <i>Rejoyce O young Man in thy youth,
and let thy Heart chear thee in the Dayes of thy
youth, and walk in the ways of thy Heart, and in
the sight of thine Eyes.</i> Thus far the Devil would
have us to Read; and he'll make many a fine
Comment upon it; he'll tell us, That if we'll
follow the Courses of the World, we shall swim
in all the Delights of the World. But he is not
willing you should Read out the next words;
<i>But know thou, that for all these things God shall
bring thee into judgment</i>. O he's loth we should
be aware of the dreadful Issues, and Reckonings
that our Worldly Delights will be attended with.
He sets before us, the <i>Pleasures of Sin;</i> but he
will not say, <i>These are but for a Season</i>. He sets
before us, <i>The Sweet Waters of Stealth?</i> but he
will not say, <i>There is Death in the Pot</i>. He is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
<i>Mountebank</i>, that will bestow nothing but Romantic
Praises upon all that he makes us the
Offers of.</p>

<p>[96] II. There are most Hellish <i>Blasphemies</i>
often buzz'd by the <i>Temptations</i> of the Devil, into
the minds of the best Men alive. What a most
Execrable Thing was here laid before our Lord
Himself: Even, To own the <i>Devil</i> as <i>God!</i> a
thing that can't be uttered, without unutterable
Horror of Soul. The best man on earth, may
have such <i>Fiery Darts</i> from Hell shot into his
mind. One that was acted by the <i>Devil</i>, had the
impudence to propound this unto such a good
man as <i>Job, Curse God</i>. And the Devil pleases
himself, by chasing the Hearts of good men, with
his base Injections, <i>That there is no God</i>, or, <i>That
God is not a Righteous God;</i> and a thousand more
such things, too Devilish to be mentioned. A
good man is extreamly grieved at it, when he
hears a <i>Blasphemy</i> from the mouth of another
man; said the Psalmist, in Psal. 44. 15, 16. <i>My
Confusion is continually before me, for the voice of
him that Blasphemeth.</i> But much more when a
good man finds a <i>Blasphemy</i> in his own Heart;
O it throws him into most Fevourish Agonies of
Soul. For this cause, a mischievous Devil will
<i>Flie blow</i> the Heart of such a man, with such
Blasphemous Thoughts, as make him crie out,
<i>Lord I am e'n weary of my life</i>. Yea, the Devil
serves the man just as the Mistress of <i>Joseph</i> dealt
with him; he importunes the man to think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
wickedly from Day to Day; and if the man refuse,
he cries out at last, <i>Behold what wicked
thoughts this man has lodging in him</i>. Sayst thou
so? <i>Satan!</i> No, they are Brats of thy own; and
at thy Door alone shall they be laid for ever.</p>

<p>III. There is a sort of Witchcrafts in those
things, whereto the Temptations of the Devil
would inveigle us. To worship the Devil is
Witchcraft, and under that notion was our Lord
urged unto sin. We are told in <i>1 Sam.</i> 15. 23.
<i>Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft:</i> When the
Devil would have us to sin, he would have us to
do the things which the forlorn Witches use to
do. Perhaps there are few persons, ever allured
by the Devil unto an Explicit Covenant with
himself. If any among ourselves be so, my councel
is, that you hunt the Devil from you, with
such words as the Psalmist had, <i>Be gone, Depart
from me, ye evil Doers, for I will keep the Commandments
of my God</i>. But alas, the most of men,
are by the Devil put upon doing the things that
are Analagous to the worst usages of Witches.
The Devil says to the sinner, <i>Despise thy Baptism,
and all the Bond of it, and all the Good of it</i>. The
Devil says to the sinner, <i>Come, cast off the Authority
of God, and, and refuse the Salvation of Christ for
ever</i>. Yea, the Devil who is called, <i>The God of
this World</i>, would have us to take Him for our
God, and rather Hear Him, Trust Him, Serve
Him, than the God that formed us.</p>

<p>[97] IV. The <i>Temptations</i> of the Devil do Tug
and Pull for nothing more, than that the Rulers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
of the World may yield Homage unto him. Our
Lord has had this by his Father Engag'd unto
him, <i>That he shall one day be Governour of the
Nations</i>. The Devil doe's extreamly dread the
approach of that Illustrious time, when <i>The Kingdom
of God shall come and his Will be done, as in
Heaven, and on Earth</i>. For this cause it was that
he was desirous, Our Lord should rather have
accepted of him, that Kingdom, which <i>Antichrist</i>
afterwards accepted of him, for the Establishment
of <i>Devil-worship</i>, in the World. I may tell you,
The Devil is mighty unwilling, that there should
be one <i>Godly Magistrate</i> upon the face of the
Earth. Such is the influence of <i>Government</i>, that
the Devil will every where stickle mightily, to
have that siding with him. What <i>Rulers</i> would
the Devil have, to command all mankind, if he
might have his will? Even, such as are called in
Psal. 94. 20. <i>The throne of iniquity, which frames
mischief by a Law;</i> such as will promote Vice, by
both Connivance and Example; and such as will
oppress all that shall be <i>Holy, and Just, and Good</i>.
All men have cause therefore to be jealous, what
Use the Devil may make of them, with reference
to the Affairs of Government; but Rulers
may most of all think, that the Lord Jesus from
Heaven calls upon them, <i>Satan has desired that he
might Sift you, and have you; O Look to it, what
side you take</i>.</p>

<p>Thus have you in the Temptations of our Lord,
seen the principal of those Devices, which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
Devil has to Entrap our Souls. But what shall
we now do, that we may be fortified against
those Devices? O that we might be well furnished
with the <i>Whole Armour of God!</i> But me
thinks, there were some things attending the
Temptations of our Lord, which, would especially
Recommend those few Hints unto us for
our Guard.</p>

<p>First, If you are not fond of Temptation, be
not fond of Needless, or Too much Retirement.
Where was it, that the Devil fell upon our Lord?
it was when he was Alone in the Wilderness.
We should all have our Times to be Alone every
Day; and if the Devil go to scare us out of our
Chambers, with such a Bugbear, as that he'll
appear to us, yet stay in spite of his teeth, stay to
finish your Devotions; he Lyes, he dare not shew
his head. But on the other-side by being too
solitary, we may lay our selves too much open to
the Devil; You know who says, <i>Wo to him that
is alone</i>.</p>

<p>[98] Secondly, Let an <i>Oracle</i> of God be your
defence against a <i>Temptation</i> of <i>Hell</i>. How did
our Lord silence the <i>Devil?</i> It was with an, <i>It is
written!</i> And <i>all</i> his Three Citations were from
that one Book of <i>Deuteronomy</i>. What a <i>full</i>
Armoury then have we, in <i>all</i> the sacred Pages
that lie before us? Whatever the Words of the
<i>Devil</i> are, drown them with the words of the
<i>Great God</i>. Say, It is <i>Written</i> The <i>Belshazzar</i>
of <i>Hell</i> will Tremble and Withdraw, if you show
these <i>Hand-Writings</i> of the Lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>

 Lastly, Since the Lord Jesus Christ has conquered
all the <i>Temptations</i> of the Devil, Flie to
that Lord, Crie to that Lord, that He would give
you a share in his Happy Victory. It was for
Us that our Lord overcome the Devil: and when
he did but say, <i>Satan, Get hence</i>, away presently
the Tygre flew: Does the Devil molest Us?
Then let us Repair to our Lord, who says, <i>I know
how to succour the Tempted</i>. Said the <i>Psalmist</i>,
<i>Psal.</i> 61. 2. <i>Lead me to the Rock that is higher
than I.</i> A Woman in this Land being under the
Possession of Devils, the Devils within her, audibly
spoke of diverse Harms they would inflict
upon her; but still they made this answer, <i>Ah!
She Runs to the Rock! She Runs to the Rock!</i> and
that hindered all. O this <i>Running to the Rock;</i>
'tis the best Preservation in the World; the <i>Vultures</i>
of <i>Hell</i> cannot prey upon the <i>Doves</i> in the
<i>Clefts</i> of that <i>Rock</i>. May our God now lead us
thereunto.

the Author merely gave the Initials
of the Name of Mr. Burroughs is
left to Conjecture. Perhaps he
considered him deeper in the
Devil's Arts than the Rest of the
accused, and perhaps he (the Author)
had been more uncharitable
towards him than towards others.
See the Rev. Mr. Upham's highly
interesting <i>Lectures on Witchcraft</i>,
101, <i>et seq.</i> He was "the most
prominent Victim of the diabolical
Fanaticism of 1692. He was Son
of that 'Mrs. Rebecca Burrows,
who came from Virginia when her
Son was quite young.' He was admitted
a Member of Mr. Eliot's
Church, Roxbury, 12 Apl., 1674.
Probably his Father had died in
Virginia, and we may hope, that
the Mother also had gone to another
World before the sad Proof
of Perverseness of God's Ordinances
in her chosen Refuge by the horrible
Proceedings against her only Child."&mdash;<i>Savage.</i>
His Wife, as will appear
presently, was a Sister of "Mr.
Ruck" of Salem. See Mr. Willis's
<i>Hist. Portland</i>.</p></div>

preached at Salem Village; and on
the 24th of March, 1692, he there
preached a Sermon, entitled "<i>Christ's
Fidelity the only Shield against Satan's
Malignity;</i> being Lecture
Day, and a Time of Publick Examination,
of some Suspected for
Witchcraft." The second Edition
of this Sermon was reprinted in
London is 1704, in 12mo. Mr.
Lawson was a sincere Believer in
Witchcraft, and in his dedicatory
Remarks, hopes "that it may please
the ALMIGHTY GOD, to manifest
his Power, in putting an End to
your Sorrows of this Nature, by
bruising <i>Satan</i> under your Feet
shortly."&mdash;What is at present known
of him and his Family will be found
in Savage, under the appropriate
Head. Respecting his Wife and
Daughter, he says they had been
dead above three Years. <i>Appendix</i>

this Case of Mr. Burroughs, as related
by our Author, and to which we
are at a Loss to find Words denunciatory
enough to apply, to read the
Conclusion to which my learned
and judicious Friend, Mr. Willis
comes, after a full View of all the
Circumstances: "There has nothing
survived Mr. Burroughs, either
in his Living or Dying, that casts
any Reproach upon his Character;
and although he died the Victim of
Fanaticism as wicked and stupid as
any which has ever been countenanced
in civilized Society, and
which for a Time prejudiced his
Memory, yet his Reputation stands
redeemed in a more enlightened
Age from any Blemish."&mdash;<i>History

appears to have been simply Bridget
Oliver, and in that Year she was
accused of being a Witch. "Feb.
22, the Negro of John Ingersol testified,
before the Court of Commissioners,
that he saw the Shape of
said Bridget on a Beam of the Barn,
with an Egg in its Hand, and that
while he looked for a Rake or Pitchfork
to strike it with, it vanished."
She was ordered to give Bonds or
go to Prison. See Felt, <i>Annals of
Salem</i>, 265. She was the Wife of
Edward Bishop, as will be seen further
on. Her Husband was probably
the Son of the first Edward
Bishop of Salem. The Paternity
of Bridget is uncertain. She may
have been of the Family of Thomas
Oliver, whose coming to Salem is
recorded in the <i>Founders of New
England</i>.</p></div>

at Topsfield. On May 13th, 1692,
William Hobbs of that Place was
taken and sent to the Jail in Boston.
On the 23d of the same Month
Deliverance and Abigail, probably

called because "the old Man, George
<i>Lowder</i> lived on the western Corner
where the West House is."&mdash;<i>Hist.

Hannah, born 3d March, 1689,
Elizabeth, 3d Sept., 1692, and Son
Oliver, born 17th June, 1698. This
was a Salisbury Family. The <i>Joseph</i>
Ring, mentioned in the next
Section, was perhaps that Joseph
born the 3d of August, 1664 (at
Salisbury), Son of Robert. Instead
of this Robert <i>Ring</i> having come
over in the Ship Bevis, in 1638, it does not appear that any Person of
the Name of Ring came at that
Time in that Ship. Mr. Savage
"strangely" says Robert Ring came
over in the Bevis of Northampton,
and stranger still there is no Robert
<i>Ring</i> on <i>his own</i> List of Passengers.
For Robert <i>Knight</i> he copied (or
some one for him), Robert <i>Ringht!</i>
Being unwilling to admit a new
Name into his Dictionary, he has
committed a more serious Blunder.

in the Execution of this
"poor Man" can only find a Parallel
in an Age as benighted as this
of 1692. A more diabolical Depravity
could never exhibit itself in
human Nature. The next Story
seems to be introduced to lessen the
Odium which it is probable the

that a foul Murder should
have been kept so still, and then, at a

"Those [Witches] of Elfdale
confessed, That the Devil used
to play upon an Harp before them,
and afterwards to go with them
that he liked best, into a Chamber,
where he committed venerous Acts
with them; and this indeed all confessed;
That he had carnal Knowledge

had Sons and Daughters by them,
which he did marry together, and
brought forth Toads and Serpents."&mdash;<i>Page</i>

<p>
"They [the bewitched] said they
had sometimes seen a very great
Devil like a Dragon, with Fire round
about him, and bound with an iron
Chain; and the Devil that converses
with them tells them, that if they
confess anything, he will let that
great Devil loose upon them, whereby
all Sweedland shall come into
great danger."&mdash;<i>Page</i> 492.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_208_208" id="Footnote_208_208"></a><a href="#FNanchor_208_208"><span class="label">[208]</span></a> The Editor feeling quite confident,
that the Reader, by this
Time, has got enough of the Devil,
will forbear making any Remarks
or Comments. Why the Author
should place his "Discovery" at
the End of his Book the Reader is
as well qualified to judge as the
Editor, and he will only add, that
it is a Pity that he (the Author)
had not made the Discovery sooner,
if by that Discovery the poor
Witches had been let alone, and
left out of the Question, as no real
Use of them is conceivable, when, in
Reality the Devil could and actually
did do all the Mischief himself.
</p>
<p>
As has been before intimated,
Dr. Mather was not alone in his
Estimation of the Importance of the
Devil. Mr. Lawson, in his Sermon
at Salem Village, before referred to,
among other Passages, said to his
Hearers (who were above a thousand):
"It is Matter of TERROR,
<i>Amazement, and Astonishment, to all
such wretched Souls</i>, (if there be
any here in the Congregation, and
God grant that none of you may
ever be found as such) <i>as have given
up their Names, and</i> Souls <i>to the
Devil:</i> Who by Covenant have
bound themselves to be his Slaves
and Drudges, consenting to be Instruments,
in whose Shapes, he may
torment and afflict their Fellow-creatures,
to the amazing and astoning
of the Standers by."&mdash;<i>Page</i> 64.
</p>
<p>
Similar Extracts might be made
from many of the Writings of that
Day, but Time and Space are inadequate,
and the Reader, who may
now incline to a better Acquaintance
with the Devil, than these
Pages afford him, must be referred
to Dr. Mather's Cotemporaries.
</p>
<p>
In closing these Notes it should
be mentioned that the Text of this
Edition of the <i>Wonders of the Invisible
World</i> has been set up from
the latest London Edition of that
Work, as mentioned in the Preface
to this Edition. When that Preface
was written it was not contemplated
to use the Original Edition
in reading the Proofs. But it
was finally decided to read by the
Original. By this Course the Text
has been to some Extent improved.
Yet no Difference of Importance
was found. The Departures of the
London Publisher were only verbal&mdash;never
altering the Sense. At
the Expense of a little tautological
Verbiage the whole has been made
conformable to the original Edition&mdash;manifest
typographical Errors excepted.</p></div></div>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
